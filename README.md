# recipe-scraper

This is a personal project that I needed to make because of how frustrated I get with recipe blogs. Currently, it is set up to extract all of the recipe info from Sally's Baking Addiction. 
The next step is to create a frontend in order to display the data so I can access my favorite recipes without all of the fluff and ads that ruin performance.

In order to run the scraper, use `python3 scrape.py`
all files will be created/updated inside the `sallys-baking-addiction` folder
