    "ingredients": [
      "2 and 1/2 cups (313g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), plus more as needed for hands and work surface",
      "2 Tablespoons aluminum free\u00a0baking powder (yes, Tablespoons)",
      "1 teaspoon salt",
      "1/2 cup (1 stick; 113g) unsalted butter, cubed and very cold (see note)",
      "1 cup + 2 Tablespoons (270ml) cold buttermilk, divided",
      "2 teaspoons (14g)\u00a0honey",
      "optional honey butter topping: 2 Tablespoons melted butter mixed with 1 Tablespoon honey"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (218\u00b0C).",
      "Make the biscuits: Place the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl or in a large food processor. Whisk or pulse until combined. Add the cubed butter and cut into the dry ingredients with a pastry cutter or by pulsing several times in the processor. Cut/pulse until coarse crumbs form. See photo above for a visual. If you used a food processor, pour the mixture into a large bowl.",
      "Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour 1 cup (240ml) buttermilk and drizzle honey on top. Fold everything together with a large spoon or spatula until it begins to come together. Do not overwork the dough. The dough will be shaggy and crumbly with some wet spots. See photo above for a visual.",
      "Pour the dough and any dough crumbles onto a floured work surface and gently bring together with generously floured hands. The dough will become sticky as you bring it together. Have extra flour nearby and use it often to flour your hands and work surface in this step. Using floured hands, flatten into a 3/4 inch thick rectangle as best you can. Fold one side into the center, then the other side on top. Turn the dough horizontally. Gently flatten into a 3/4 inch thick rectangle again. Repeat the folding again. Turn the dough horizontally one more time. Gently flatten into a 3/4 inch thick rectangle. Repeat the folding one last time. Flatten into the final 3/4 inch thick rectangle.",
      "Cut into 2.5 or 3-inch circles with a biscuit cutter. (Tip: Do not twist the biscuit cutter when pressing down into the dough because this seals off the edges of the biscuit which prevents them from fully rising.) Re-roll scraps until all the dough is used. You should have about 8-10 biscuits. Arrange in a 10-inch cast iron skillet (see note) or close together on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Make sure the biscuits are touching.",
      "Brush the tops with remaining buttermilk. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until tops are golden brown.",
      "Remove from the oven, and then brush warm tops with optional honey butter, and serve warm.",
      "Cover leftovers tightly and store at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Baked biscuits freeze well for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature or in the refrigerator, then warm up to your liking before serving. You can also freeze the biscuit dough. Prepare the dough in steps 2 through 4. Wrap up tightly in plastic wrap (plastic wrap is best for freshness) and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then continue with step 5. Also, after step 4, you can wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 2 days before continuing with step 5.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Pastry Cutter or Food Processor | 2.5- or 3-Inch Biscuit Cutter\u00a0| 10-inch Cast Iron Skillet | Pastry Brush",
      "Baking Powder: To avoid a chemical aftertaste, make sure your baking powder is labeled aluminum free. I usually use Clabber Girl brand and though the ingredients state aluminum, I\u2019ve never noticed an aluminum aftertaste. Alternatively, you can reduce the baking powder down to 1 Tablespoon and add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda.",
      "Butter: Cut into 1/2-inch cubes. Keep butter as cold as possible until you need it. I recommend placing the cubed butter in the freezer for about 15 minutes before you begin.",
      "Buttermilk: You can substitute whole milk for buttermilk if desired. However if you\u2019d like the tangy flavor, which I highly recommend, you can make your own sour milk substitute. Add 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice or white vinegar to a liquid measuring cup. Add enough milk to make 1 cup. (You need 1 cup in the recipe, plus 2 Tbsp for brushing\u2013you can use regular milk to brush on top.) Whisk together, then let sit for 5 minutes before using in the recipe. Whole milk is best for the DIY sour milk substitute, though lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch. (In my testing, the biscuits don\u2019t taste as rich or rise quite as tall using lower fat or nondairy milks.)",
      "Cast Iron Skillet: If your cast iron skillet isn\u2019t well seasoned, I recommend greasing it with a little vegetable oil or melted butter. Brush a thin layer of either on the bottom and around the sides. No need to heat the cast iron skillet before using, though you certainly can. Place in the preheated oven for 15 minutes before arranging the shaped biscuits in it.",
      "Flavors: Try my flavorful biscuit variations: cheddar biscuits and everything bagel biscuits."

    "ingredients": [
      "2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour\u00a0(spooned & leveled)",
      "2 teaspoons baking powder",
      "1 teaspoon baking soda",

      "In a large bowl, preferably with a pour spout, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together until combined. Set aside.",
      "For this step, I like to use a blender. I use my Ninja blender. A blender guarantees an incredibly smooth batter and also breaks down the heavy pumpkin in the process. This is especially necessary if you are using fresh pumpkin puree. Add the pumpkin, brown sugar, egg, oil, and whole milk to a blender and blend on high for 45 seconds until combined. Alternatively, you may whisk by hand or use a hand mixer.",
      "Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk gently to combine. Make sure there are no patches of dry flour at the bottom of the bowl. The batter is very thick and a few lumps are fine. Fold in the chocolate chips, if using.",
      "Heat a griddle or large flat skillet over medium heat. (If using an electric griddle, preheat it to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).) Coat generously with butter or nonstick cooking spray. Once it\u2019s hot, drop/pour a heaping 1/4 cup of batter on the griddle. Cook until the edges look set and you notice holes in the pancake\u2019s surface around the border, about 2\u20133 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until cooked through, about 1\u20132 more minutes. Coat griddle/skillet with butter or nonstick spray again, if needed, for each batch of pancakes.",
      "Keep pancakes warm in a preheated 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C) oven until all pancakes are cooked. Serve pancakes immediately with toppings of choice like butter and pure maple syrup. I also really like serving these with the maple pecan topping from this pumpkin waffles recipe.",
      "Cover and store leftover pancakes in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Pancakes freeze well up to 3 months. Reheat frozen pancakes in the microwave. Or you can reheat frozen pancakes in a 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) oven. Place pancakes on a lined baking sheet and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Bake for 6\u20138 minutes or until defrosted and warm.",
      "Can I make the batter the night before? No, I don\u2019t recommend it. Baking powder is activated once wet. You can, however, mix the dry ingredients and wet ingredients together and keep them separate and covered in the refrigerator until the morning.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Mixing Bowls | Blender | Whisk | Electric Griddle, Griddle Pan, or Shallow Skillet/Pan",
      "Flour: I strongly recommend all-purpose flour. Because pumpkin is so heavy, substituting whole wheat flour will create incredibly heavy, dense pancakes. If you want to use some whole wheat flour, substitute in 1 cup (about 125\u2013130g), and increase the milk to 1 and 3/4 cups.",
      "Pumpkin Pie Spice: You can find pumpkin pie spice in the baking aisle of most grocery stores, or make your own homemade pumpkin pie spice. If you don\u2019t have either and want to use individual spices, use 1/4 teaspoon each: ground ginger, ground nutmeg, ground cloves, and ground allspice. This is in addition to the 2 teaspoons of cinnamon\u2014you will still add that as well.",
      "Milk: Whole milk is key to rich and tender pancakes. If you don\u2019t have it, the best substitute would be buttermilk. If you don\u2019t have that either, lower-fat or a nondairy milk can be subbed."

Cover tightly and refrigerate until you\u2019re ready to bake it. Remove the casserole from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature while your oven preheats. You can freeze leftover baked and cooled casserole for up to 3 months.

      "Bread: Crusty, somewhat stale bread is best for French toast casseroles. If you\u2019re in a rush and don\u2019t have time to let the bread sit out as instructed in step 1, lay the bread slices on baking sheets in a single layer and bake in a 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) oven for 10 minutes.",
      "Apple Cider: Make sure you\u2019re using apple cider the (nonalcoholic, non-carbonated) drink, not apple cider vinegar. You can use apple juice instead if cider if you must, but you\u2019ll lose some flavor. Learn how to make a homemade apple cider beverage in a slow cooker.",
      "Milk: Whole milk is best because it produces a rich casserole that isn\u2019t too heavy. You can use lower-fat or nondairy milks in a pinch. Half-and-half works, too. I found heavy cream too heavy and rich for this casserole.",

    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm milk, 2 Tablespoons sugar, and the yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/rubber spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula is a better choice.*",
      "On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs, vanilla, and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won\u2019t really be mixing into the mixture, so don\u2019t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it\u2019s fully incorporated before adding the next. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft.",
      "Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if you used the paddle) and beat on low speed for an additional 5 minutes OR knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes. If kneading by hand, keep a small bowl of flour nearby to continually flour your hands, as the dough can be quite sticky. After kneading, poke the dough with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.\u00a0",
      "1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise?\u00a0in my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Grease the bottom and sides of a metal or glass 9\u00d713-inch baking dish or line with parchment paper.",
      "Roll out the dough: Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 12\u00d718-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you\u2019re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier.",
      "Make the filling: Melt 2 Tablespoons (28g) of the butter. Reserve the rest for step 8. Whisk the flour, sugar, brown sugar, powdered coffee creamer, and salt together. Using a fork, mix in the melted butter and the vanilla extract until crumbly. Mix in the sprinkles. (*You will use the cinnamon in the next step.*)",
      "Spread dough with the remaining butter (6 Tablespoons). Sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon, and then the sprinkle filling mixture evenly on top. Tightly roll up the dough to form an 18-inch-long log. With an extra sharp knife, cut into 12 even rolls, about 1.5 inches each. Arrange in the prepared baking pan.",
      "2nd Rise: Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until puffy, about 1 hour. (Or use the overnight option in the Notes below.)",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).",
      "Bake for about 25\u201328 minutes or until they are lightly browned on top. About halfway through baking time, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes as you make the icing.",
      "Make the icing: In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth and creamy. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, cream/milk, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 1 minute. Spread the icing over the warm rolls, garnish with extra sprinkles if desired, and serve immediately.",
      "Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Overnight: To prepare the night before serving, prepare the rolls through step 8. Cover the rolls tightly and refrigerate for 8\u201312 hours. (16 hours max. 8\u201312 hours is best, but 16 hours is OK if absolutely needed. Do not exceed 16 hours.) The next morning, remove from the refrigerator and allow to rise on the counter for 1\u20132 hours before continuing with step 10.",
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Freezing: Baked rolls can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and warm up before enjoying. You can also freeze the unbaked rolls and here\u2019s how: bake the rolls in step 9 for only about 10 minutes. Cool completely, then cover tightly and freeze. To serve, take the rolls out of the freezer and place in the refrigerator overnight to thaw. Once thawed, finish baking them for about 15\u201320 minutes.",

      "Milk: I recommend using whole milk for the best, richest-tasting dough. You could also use buttermilk. Reduced-fat, low-fat, or nondairy milk works in a pinch. Do not use nonfat milk.",
      "Yeast: You can use active dry or instant yeast in this recipe. Follow all of the same instructions. If using active dry yeast, the rise times are usually slightly longer. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Vanilla: I love using vanilla bean paste in this recipe because it combines both extract AND vanilla bean seeds, and tastes phenomenal in the dough AND icing. You can, of course, use pure vanilla extract instead.",
      "Powdered Coffee Creamer: This ingredient is important in the filling. It adds a creamy-like consistency and taste to the filling, which helps the filling replicate cake mix or cake batter. If you don\u2019t have it, you can use the same amount of nonfat instant dry milk instead.",
      "Alternate Icing Option: Instead of cream cheese icing, you can top the warm rolls with vanilla icing."

For doughnut success, follow my step-by-step photos, helpful success tips, and video tutorial below.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup (240ml) whole milk, warmed to about 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C)*",
      "2 and 1/4 teaspoons (7g) instant or active dry yeast\u00a0(1 standard packet)*",

      "2 large eggs",
      "6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled",
      "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg",

      "1/3 cup (80ml) heavy cream, half-and-half, or whole milk",
      "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm milk, yeast, and 1 Tablespoon sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer. Loosely cover and allow to sit for 5\u201310 minutes until foamy and frothy on top. *If you do not own a stand mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl, and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/rubber spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula is a better choice.*",
      "Add the remaining sugar, the eggs, butter, vanilla, nutmeg, salt, and 2 cups (about 250g) flour. Beat on low speed for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add remaining flour and beat on medium speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. If needed, add more flour, 1 Tablespoon at a time, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Don\u2019t add too much flour, though. You want a slightly sticky dough.",
      "Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment and beat on low speed for an additional 5\u20137 minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5\u20137 minutes. After kneading, the dough should be smooth and elastic, but still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.",
      "Let Dough Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl and allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1.5\u20132 hours or until double in size. (For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise?\u00a0in my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Shape Doughnuts: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Remove dough from the bowl and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out until it is 1/2 inch thick. Using a 3\u20133.5-inch doughnut cutter, cut into doughnuts. Re-roll the scraps and cut more. *If you don\u2019t have a doughnut cutter, you can use 1 large + 1 smaller circle cookie cutter (large should be about 3 and 1/2 inches).",
      "Line 1 or 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Place doughnuts and doughnut holes on each. Loosely cover and allow to rest for 30 minutes as you heat the oil. They will rise a bit as they rest. Place a cooling rack over another baking sheet.",
      "Pour oil into a large heavy-duty pot fitted with an oil thermometer. Turn stove on to medium heat. Heat oil to 375\u00b0F (191\u00b0C). Add 2\u20133 doughnuts at a time and cook for 1 minute on each side. Carefully remove with a metal slotted spatula or metal slotted spoon. Be sure to lower stove\u2019s temperature if oil temperature is rising; you want it to stay at 375\u00b0F (191\u00b0C). Wear kitchen gloves if oil is splashing. Place fried doughnuts onto prepared rack. Repeat with remaining doughnuts, then turn off heat.* (See Note for doughnut holes.)",
      "Make the glaze: Whisk all the glaze ingredients together. Dip each warm doughnut (don\u2019t wait for them to cool!) into the glaze, making sure to coat both sides. Place back onto prepared rack, as excess glaze drips down. After about 20 minutes, the glaze will set.",
      "Doughnuts are best enjoyed the same day. You can store leftover doughnuts in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for another day or two."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: Prepare recipe through step 5. Freeze shaped doughnuts for up to 3 months. On the day you serve them, let the doughnuts thaw and rest at room temperature for about 4\u20135 hours. Fry as directed. You can also freeze the fried doughnuts (unglazed). Allow them to cool completely, then freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature, then reheat as desired (microwave is great) and dunk in freshly made glaze.",
      "Overnight Instructions: Complete dough through step 3. Instead of allowing to rise in a warm environment in step 4, place the covered dough in the refrigerator overnight (8\u201312 hours). The next morning, remove from the refrigerator and allow to rise in a warm environment until doubled. The dough will lightly rise in the refrigerator overnight, so the rise the next morning won\u2019t take too long. After rising, continue with step 5.",

      "Doughnut Holes: Add holes to hot oil and fry until golden, about 30 seconds, on each side.",
      "Milk: Whole milk is a must for the most tender dough\u2014or you can try buttermilk. Lower-fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch, but the doughnuts aren\u2019t as flavorful or rich.",
      "Yeast: If using an instant yeast, your rise time will be a little shorter. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Oil: The amount of oil really depends on how wide or tall your pot is. You want oil to fill about 1/3 of the pot. I use a little more than 1 quart for my 4 and 1/2-quart Dutch oven.",
      "Leftover Oil: Do not pour used oil down the sink drain. Allow to cool, then pour into an empty container (a funnel is useful here) and discard in the trash or reuse it.",

Dip the donuts into the strawberry frosting 2 or 3 times (it\u2019s thinner than the others), then cover with sprinkles, if desired.",
      "Vanilla frosting: Whisk the melted butter, confectioners\u2019 sugar, vanilla extract, 2 Tablespoons (30ml) of milk, and salt together in a medium bowl. Whisk in the remaining 1 Tablespoon (15ml) of milk to thin, if desired. It\u2019s easier to dip the donuts if the glaze is thinner.

      "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm milk, 2 Tablespoons sugar, and the yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/rubber spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula is a better choice.*",
      "On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs, vanilla, and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won\u2019t really be mixing into the mixture, so don\u2019t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it\u2019s fully incorporated before adding the next. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft.",
      "Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if you used the paddle) and beat on low speed for an additional 5 minutes OR knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes. If kneading by hand, keep a small bowl of flour nearby to continually flour your hands, as the dough can be quite sticky. After kneading, poke the dough with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.\u00a0",
      "1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise?\u00a0in my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Grease the bottom and sides of a metal or glass 9\u00d713-inch baking dish or line with parchment paper.",
      "Roll out the dough: Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 12\u00d718-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you\u2019re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier.",
      "Make the filling: In a medium bowl, toss the frozen raspberries with the sugar and cornstarch. Spread the cold sugared raspberries evenly over the dough. Tightly roll up the dough to form an 18-inch-long log. With an extra sharp knife, cut into 12 even rolls, about 1.5 inches each. Arrange in the prepared baking pan.",
      "2nd Rise: Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until puffy, about 90 minutes. (Or use the overnight option in the Notes below.) The berries will release their juice at the bottom of the pan\u2014this is OK.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).",
      "Bake for about 28\u201332 minutes or until they are lightly browned on top. About halfway through baking time, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes as you make the icing.",
      "Make the icing: In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth and creamy. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, cream/milk, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 1 minute. Spread the icing over the warm rolls and serve immediately.",
      "Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."

      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Overnight: To prepare the night before serving, prepare the rolls through step 7. Cover the rolls tightly and refrigerate for 8\u201312 hours. (16 hours max. 8\u201312 hours is best, but 16 hours is OK if absolutely needed. Do not exceed 16 hours.) The next morning, remove from the refrigerator and allow to rise on the counter for 1\u20132 hours before continuing with step 9.",
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Freezing: Baked rolls can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and warm up before enjoying. You can also freeze the unbaked rolls and here\u2019s how: bake the rolls in step 9 for only about 10 minutes. Cool completely, then cover tightly and freeze. To serve, take the rolls out of the freezer and place in the refrigerator overnight to thaw. Once thawed, finish baking them for about 15\u201320 minutes.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Stand Mixer | Rolling Pin | 9\u00d713-Inch Glass Baking Pan or Metal Baking Pan | Glass Mixing Bowls",
      "Milk: I recommend using whole milk for the best, richest-tasting dough. You could also use buttermilk. Reduced-fat, low-fat, or nondairy milk works in a pinch. Do not use nonfat milk.",
      "Yeast:\u00a0I always use\u00a0Platinum Yeast from Red Star, an instant yeast. You can use an active dry yeast instead, if needed. The rise times could be slightly longer. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide\u00a0for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Vanilla: I love using vanilla bean paste in this recipe because it combines both extract AND vanilla bean seeds, and tastes phenomenal in the dough AND icing. You can, of course, use pure vanilla extract instead.",
      "Raspberries: You need FROZEN raspberries for the filling\u2014do not thaw. Fresh raspberries are much too juicy and delicate for the filling. If all you have is fresh, freeze them first.",
      "Alternate Icing Option: Instead of cream cheese icing, you can top the warm rolls with vanilla icing."

      "Combine the cooled melted butter, flour, sugar, salt, milk, water, eggs, and vanilla in a blender or large food processor. \u00a0If you don\u2019t have a blender or food processor, use a large mixing bowl and whisk by hand. Blend on medium-high speed for 20\u201330 seconds until everything is combined. The mixture will be silky-smooth and the consistency of cream. Cover the blender tightly or pour into a medium bowl, cover tightly, and chill in the refrigerator for 30\u201360 minutes and up to 1 day. (After refrigerating, if the batter looks separated, give it a quick stir before cooking in the next step.)",
      "Cook the crepes: Use the remaining butter for greasing the pan between each crepe. Place an 8-inch skillet over medium heat and generously grease it with some of the reserved butter. If you don\u2019t have a skillet this size, use a larger one, but make sure you keep the crepes thin. Once the skillet is hot, pour 3\u20134 Tablespoons (closer to 3 is best) of batter into the center of the pan. Tilt/twirl the pan so the batter stretches as far as it will go. The thinner the crepe, the better the texture. Cook for 1\u20132 minutes, then flip as soon as the bottom is set. Don\u2019t wait too long to flip crepes or else they will taste rubbery. Cook the other side for 30 seconds until set. Transfer the cooked crepe to a large plate and repeat with the remaining batter, making sure to butter the pan between each crepe. If desired, separate each crepe with parchment paper so they do not stick together. If you\u2019re using enough butter in your pan, though, the crepes shouldn\u2019t stick.",
      "Fill the crepes. I love serving them warm, but they\u2019re excellent at room temperature too. See my filling suggestions above this recipe or my recipe notes below. Place a few spoonfuls of your filling ingredient(s) in the center of the crepe. Fold both sides over the filling. Crepes are delicious with toppings, too, such as a drizzle of melted chocolate, melted peanut butter, or a dusting of confectioners\u2019 sugar. Or try a savory sauce like pesto or hollandaise.",
      "Leftover unfilled crepes remain fresh in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1 day or in the freezer for 1 month. Freeze each between small sheets of parchment paper so they don\u2019t stick. (I usually layer them with parchment and freeze in a large zipped-top bag.) Thaw at room temperature before filling/enjoying. See reheating instructions in the recipe Notes below."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: Batter can be made the night before. Seal tightly in your blender or pour into a mixing bowl and cover tightly, then prepare crepes the next day.

      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Food Processor or Blender (what I use) | Small 8-Inch Skillet (what I use) or Specialty Crepe Pan | Spatula",
      "Keep Warm As You Cook: The radiant heat from each crepe piled on top of one another keeps them all warm as you cook the remaining batter. If the crepes have gotten cold, place a water-moistened damp paper towel over the plate of crepes and microwave for 30 seconds. I find keeping them in a warm oven the entire time you\u2019re cooking the rest quickly dries them out.",
      "Crepe Fillings: My pictured crepes are filled with lightly sweetened orange whipped cream. To make the whipped cream, add 1 Tablespoon fresh orange juice and, if desired, 1 Tablespoon orange liqueur to my whipped cream recipe. Just add it along with the heavy cream\u2014whipped cream recipe instructions remain the same. Serve with fresh berries, orange zest, and a dusting of confectioners\u2019 sugar on top. Or use any fillings/toppings you desire. See a list of suggestions above this recipe.",
      "Milk: I prefer whole milk in the crepe batter. For a richer-tasting crepe, half-and-half or heavy cream work too. 2% is OK, but I wouldn\u2019t use lower-fat milks. Any low-fat or full-fat nondairy milk works too.",
      "Savory Crepes: The recipe as written will work for savory crepes, but I usually leave out the vanilla extract and add a pinch of ground black pepper. Feel free to add a Tablespoon of your favorite dried herb to the batter, too.",

      "Sugar: I recommend pure maple syrup because the flavor is outstanding and the baked oatmeal cups are extra moist. If you need a substitute, you can use packed brown sugar, coconut sugar, or honey.",
      "Almond Butter: Almond butter adds a little flavor. Feel free to use peanut butter or other nut butter instead, or simply leave it out for a nut-free version. If you leave it out, reduce oats to 3 cups (255g).",
      "Oats: Whole rolled oats give you the best texture. You can use quick oats instead, but they soak up more moisture so the centers won\u2019t be as moist. If using steel-cut oats, soak the oats in the milk for 30 minutes, then stir in the rest of the ingredients. Add a few extra minutes to the bake time. The oatmeal cups are best with whole oats.",
      "Ground Flaxseed: If you don\u2019t have ground flaxseed, you can leave it out with no other changes to the recipe."

      "Heat olive oil in a 2-inch-deep, 10- to 12-inch-diameter oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for about 30\u201360 seconds (don\u2019t let it brown). Continue with either version below.",
      "Add the red onion and sweet potato to the pan with the garlic. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften. Add the zucchini and red peppers, and season with salt and pepper. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",

Cool baked frittata completely, cut into slices, transfer slices to a freezer-friendly container, and cover tightly. Freeze for up to 3 months. When ready to eat, thaw in the refrigerator, and microwave individual slice to reheat or place slices on a lined baking sheet and bake, covered, in a 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) oven for 5\u201310 minutes, or until warmed throughout.",

      "Egg Whites Only? I don\u2019t recommend using only egg whites because you will lose a lot of richness and flavor that the yolks provide. I suggest using 2 whole eggs and 6 egg whites.",
      "Milk: Whole milk provides the best taste and texture, but you can substitute lower-fat or nondairy milk in a pinch. Using heavy cream or half-and-half will make for a creamier texture.",
      "Other add-ins: Stick with 2 to 3 cups total add-ins, and use the base recipe as the starting point for your own variation. You can pre-cook any vegetables on the stove with the olive oil, garlic, and seasonings like you do in the Garden Vegetable version. Regular white/gold/red potato, broccoli, mushrooms, and/or asparagus are also great additions. Cook until softened before pouring in the egg mixture.",
      "Can I add other meats? Yes, absolutely. You can add cooked diced ham, sliced chicken sausage, ground sausage, and/or shredded or chopped chicken. Fold pre-cooked meat into the egg-and-cheese mixture, or feel free to brown a bit with the garlic/vegetables on the stove before adding the egg mixture."

    "instructions": [
      "Melt the 6 Tablespoons of butter first. Microwave or stovetop\u2014either is fine. Set aside to slightly cool. You do not want it piping hot.",
      "In a large bowl preferably with a pour spout, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.",

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently whisk to combine. Make sure there are no patches of dry flour at the bottom of the bowl. The batter is thick and a few lumps are fine.",
      "Let the batter sit for 5 minutes as you heat the stove in the next step. This gives the batter a chance to thicken. You will fold in the sprinkles right before cooking.",
      "Meanwhile, heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Coat generously with butter or nonstick cooking spray. Once it\u2019s hot, fold the sprinkles into the batter.",
      "Drop/pour a heaping 1/4 cup of batter on the griddle. Cook until the edges look set and you notice holes in the pancake\u2019s surface around the border, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until cooked through, about 1\u20132 more minutes. Coat griddle/skillet with butter or nonstick spray again, if needed, for each batch of pancakes.",
      "Keep pancakes warm in a preheated 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C) oven until all pancakes are cooked.",
      "Make the icing: Whisk the icing ingredients together and pour over pancakes before serving. Feel free to add whipped cream and more sprinkles on top, too.",
      "Serve pancakes immediately. Cover and store leftover pancakes in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Pancakes freeze well up to 3 months. Reheat frozen pancakes in the microwave. Or you can reheat frozen pancakes in a 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) oven.

      "Can I make the batter the night before? No, I don\u2019t recommend it. Baking powder is activated once wet. You can, however, mix the dry ingredients and wet ingredients together and keep them separate and covered in the refrigerator until the morning. (But do not add the melted butter until ready to cook, because that will solidify in the refrigerator.)",
      "Can I make waffles instead? Absolutely. Use today\u2019s batter and follow the same cooking instructions as these gingerbread waffles.",
      "Can I use whole wheat flour? I recommend making my whole wheat pancakes instead, and using 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and adding the almond extract and sprinkles.",
      "Buttermilk: Though I typically suggest a DIY buttermilk option using regular milk and vinegar/lemon, I highly recommend real buttermilk for these pancakes. I use low-fat buttermilk, but full fat works too. I do not suggest any substitutions. If you have leftover buttermilk, you can use it in any of these recipes.",
      "Almond Extract: This flavor addition is what makes these pancakes taste like cake batter. It doesn\u2019t really taste like almonds. I also really like this cake & cookie bakery emulsion flavoring. You can use this flavoring to replace the almond or vanilla extracts.",
      "Sprinkles: Use rainbow sprinkles/jimmies. Do not use nonpareils (the tiny balls), which are prone to bleeding their color no matter how lightly you fold them into batter. In the photos, I used these rainbow sprinkles in the pancake batter, and these round confetti sprinkles on top of the cooked pancakes for serving.",

Microwave or use the stove and heat until the butter has melted and the mixture is warm to the touch (about 110\u00b0F/43\u00b0C, no higher). Whisk in the yeast until it has dissolved. Pour mixture into the dry ingredients, add the egg, and stir with a sturdy rubber spatula or wooden spoon, OR use a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on medium speed. Mix until a soft dough forms.",

If you notice the tops are getting too brown too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil and continue baking. If you want to be precise about their doneness, the rolls\u2019 internal temperature taken with an instant-read thermometer should be around 195\u2013200\u00b0F (91\u201393\u00b0C) when done. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack as you make the icing. (You can also make the icing as the rolls bake.)",

You can also freeze the unbaked rolls and here\u2019s how: bake the rolls in step 6 for only about 10 minutes at 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Cool completely, then cover tightly and freeze. To serve, take the pan of rolls out of the freezer and put into the refrigerator a few hours before serving. Then, finish baking them for the remaining 15\u201318 minutes.",

      "Yeast: I highly recommend instant yeast. If you only have active dry yeast, you can use that instead. Active dry and instant yeast can be used interchangeably in recipes (1:1). Active dry yeast has a moderate rate of rising and instant dry yeast has a faster rate of rising; active dry yeast will take longer to raise the dough.\u00a0Reference my Baking With Yeast Guide for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Milk: This recipe used to call for 1/2 cup (120ml) water and 1/4 cup (60ml) milk. The rolls taste much richer using all milk, and that is what I recommend. Whole milk or even buttermilk are ideal for this dough. If needed, you can substitute 3/4 cup (180ml) lower-fat or nondairy milk."

      "Almond Flour: You can use almond flour or almond meal in this recipe. Almond flour is finely ground blanched almonds. You could also use almond meal, which is coarser. You can purchase almond flour in most grocery stores, and I really like Bob\u2019s Red Mill brand. You can also make it at home, and here\u2019s how: Pulse about 3/4 cup of whole almonds (blanched or not) a few times in a food processor until the almonds are finely ground. Do not let it grind for too long or the nuts will release too much of their oil and turn into almond butter.",
      "Nut-Free: You can swap almond flour for oat flour, and leave out the sliced almonds. I find this version isn\u2019t quite as crunchy, but it does work.",
      "Oats: Whole rolled (old-fashioned) oats are the nutritious heart of these granola clusters. I don\u2019t recommend quick or instant oats here\u2014you need whole.",
      "Coconut Oil: Do not leave this out! The fat keeps granola from turning into a mushy mess and adds crunch and richness to every cluster. You can use butter instead if needed, but don\u2019t substitute a liquid oil\u2014you need a fat that\u2019s solid at room temperature.",
      "Brown Sugar: The brown sugar adds sweetness, but is also needed to thicken the sticky \u201csauce\u201d that gets poured over the dry ingredients. You can substitute coconut sugar, if desired.",
      "Add-Ins: If you want to add some extra goodies to your maple almond granola clusters\u2014such as pumpkin seeds (pepitas) or sunflower seeds, raisins, coconut flakes, dried cranberries\u2014you can, but keep the total amount of add-ins to about 1 and 1/4 cups, including the sliced almonds in the recipe. So use 3/4 cup sliced almonds and 1/2 cup of any other add-in. Keep in mind the clusters may fall apart more depending on the add-ins you use."

      "Wheat Bran: I usually find wheat bran in the cereal aisle near the oats, or you can buy it online. I like Bob\u2019s Red Mill brand (not working with them, just genuinely like their products). No need to soak it or sift it or anything before using, just add it as a dry ingredient.

The recipe is similar, and you can choose any add-ins you prefer instead of blueberries (such as raisins).",

I recommend using wheat bran for these muffins, but I know some recipes call for grinding bran cereal (either flakes or strands, such as All-Bran or Fiber One) into crumbs to use in place of wheat bran.

      "In another large bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and molasses together. Whisk in the eggs, and then the buttermilk, until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk gently until combined. Do not over-mix. Some small lumps are OK.",
      "Grease the preheated waffle maker (I use nonstick spray). Pour about 1/3 cup of the batter into each well of the waffle maker (or less if your waffle maker is smaller) and close the lid. Cook the waffles until crisp, about 4\u20135 minutes. (Follow the cooking instructions for your waffle maker.) Transfer the cooked waffles to the wire rack and keep warm in the preheated oven as you cook the rest. Repeat to cook the remaining batter.",
      "Meanwhile, as the waffles cook, make the optional maple pecan topping: Place the pecans in a saucepan or skillet set over medium-low heat. Toast the pecans for just about 4\u20135 minutes, stirring the whole time, because pecans can go from toasted to burnt in a matter of seconds. When they\u2019re giving off a subtle toasty scent, turn the heat down to low and pour in the maple syrup. Leave it on the stove for just a minute, until the syrup is warmed through, and then remove from heat.\u00a0",
      "Serve the waffles immediately with warm maple pecan syrup, or your choice of toppings."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Waffles are best enjoyed freshly made. I recommend freezing any leftover cooled waffles. Waffles can be frozen for up to 3 months, then warmed in the toaster.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Mixing Bowls (preferably with a pour spout) | Whisk |\u00a0Waffle Maker or Mini Snowflake and Gingerbread Waffle Makers | Saucepan (for optional maple pecan topping)",
      "Buttermilk: You can substitute whole milk for buttermilk if desired. However, if you\u2019d like the tangy flavor, which I highly recommend, you can make your own soured milk substitute. Add 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice or white vinegar to a liquid measuring cup. Add enough milk to make 1 and 2/3 cup. Whisk together, then let sit for 5 minutes before using in the recipe. Whole milk is best for the DIY sour milk substitute, though lower-fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch. Do not use nonfat milk.",
      "Waffle Maker: You can use this recipe in either a Belgian or traditional waffle maker or iron. The suggested cooking time is just a suggestion. Follow the cooking instructions for your specific waffle maker.",
      "Can I make these as gingerbread pancakes? Yes! No changes to the batter recipe. Heat a griddle or skillet over medium heat. Coat generously with nonstick cooking spray or butter. Once hot, drop about 1/4 cup of batter on the griddle. Cook until the edges look dry and bubbles begin to form on the surface. Flip and cook on the other side until cooked through, about 2 more minutes. Coat griddle/skillet again with cooking spray or butter for each pancake or batch of pancakes.",
      "Other Topping Suggestions:\u00a0Lemon curd; whipped cream; sugared cranberries; dusting of confectioners\u2019 sugar, sifted"

If you notice the tops are getting too brown too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil and continue baking.

Active dry yeast has a moderate rate of rising and instant dry yeast has a faster rate of rising; active dry yeast will take longer to raise the dough.",

If you notice the tops are getting too brown too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil and continue baking.

Add sausage and rosemary/Italian seasoning, if using, and break up the sausage into bite-size pieces with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula as it begins to cook. Add the onion, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, and spinach and cook until everything has slightly softened and sausage is mostly cooked through, about 5\u20136 minutes.",
      "Remove sausage and vegetable mixture from heat and spread in an even layer on top of bread.",

      "Freezing & Reheating Instructions: To freeze, prepare and assemble through step 5, cover with plastic wrap, then a layer of aluminum foil, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, and then bring to room temperature before baking as directed. You can also freeze the baked casserole for up to 3 months and when doing that, I suggest baking it in a disposable aluminum pan. Cool completely, cover with plastic wrap, then a layer of aluminum foil. When ready to eat, thaw it for about 24 hours (covered) in the refrigerator, remove the plastic wrap layer, then bake in a 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) oven for 25\u201330 minutes.",

      "Bread: Crusty sourdough is fantastic in this recipe, or use any crusty, hearty bread. The crustier or more stale, the better. If your bread is fresh and/or flimsy, cut into cubes and bake on a baking sheet in a 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) oven for 10 minutes. It\u2019ll be slightly crisp and ready to use in this recipe. No need to wait for the bread to cool before layering into the baking dish.",
      "Using Potatoes Instead of Bread: You can replace the bread with diced hash brown potatoes\u2014the kind you find in the freezer section of the grocery store. Use about 3 cups (around 380g) of frozen hash brown potatoes, no need to thaw. You could also peel and dice fresh potatoes, but you\u2019ll need to quickly cook/brown them on a skillet with 1 Tablespoon olive oil over medium heat for 10 minutes before using.",
      "Sausage or Other Meat: If using pre-cooked sausage links or ham, cut into slices/chunks, and there is no need to cook either. Simply stir into the pre-cooked vegetables before layering into the dish. You can replace the sausage with ground turkey, beef, or chicken\u2014simply pre-cook with the vegetables according to the instructions. If using bacon, I recommend reducing to 1/2 pound and cutting into bite-size pieces. Cook separately from the vegetables until browned. Drain, then mix with the vegetables before layering into the dish.",
      "Other Vegetables: Feel free to replace all or some of the bell peppers, mushrooms, and spinach with other vegetables such as chopped broccoli, sliced zucchini or squash, or kale. Pre-cook as directed.",
      "Vegetarian Option: You can leave out the meat and replace with another 1 cup of vegetables.",
      "Milk: For the richest, heartiest texture, I recommend half-and-half or whole milk. You can use lower-fat milk or dairy-free milk if desired.",
      "Cheese: I usually use a blend of regular and sharp white cheddar cheeses. Use whatever cheeses you like best, such as pepper jack, feta cheese, Swiss, and/or smoked gouda.",
      "Half Recipe: You can halve this recipe by halving all of the ingredients and using a 9\u00d79-inch square pan. Bake time is slightly shorter, about 32\u201336 minutes."

Beat in the confectioners\u2019 sugar and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract until combined. Drop random spoonfuls of cream cheese mixture on top of the bread. Top with most of the berries (reserve a few berries for the top, for looks) and then the remaining bread cubes. Place any reserved berries on top. Set aside.",
      "Whisk the eggs, milk, cinnamon, brown sugar, and remaining vanilla extract together until combined. Pour evenly over the bread. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3\u20134 hours and up to 24 hours. Overnight is best.",

    "instructions": [
      "Preliminary notes: Watch the video tutorial and use the step-by-step photos before you begin. Read the recipe instructions and notes before beginning. Make room in the refrigerator for your half baking sheet for steps 6\u20139.",
      "Prepare the dough: In a large ungreased mixing bowl, whisk the warm milk, yeast, and sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/rubber spatula. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula is a better choice.*",
      "Add the salt, butter, and 2 cups (250g) of flour. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, stopping and scraping down the bowl as needed to help the mixture combine. There may still be chunks of butter\u2013 that\u2019s ok. Add remaining flour, scrape down the bowl as needed, and beat on low speed until a soft dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Dough will be very soft, but not overly sticky. Beat in 2\u20133 more Tablespoons of flour if dough seems very sticky. Avoid adding more flour than you need.",
      "Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat on low speed for an additional 3 minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 3 minutes.",
      "1st rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides of the dough in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1.5\u20132 hours or until nearly double in size. (For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise?\u00a0in my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Flatten dough: Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a silicone baking mat-lined, parchment paper-lined, or lightly floured baking sheet. (I highly recommend a silicone baking mat because you can roll the dough out in the next steps directly on top and it won\u2019t slide all over the counter.) Gently flatten the dough out into a 10\u00d714-inch (25x35cm) rectangle using lightly floured hands to carefully stretch, but not tear, the dough. Lightly cover and place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator, and allow the covered dough to rest and chill for 20 minutes. Do not extend this time.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare for lamination: Cut the salted butter into 1/4-inch thick slices and, as explained in the recipe note below, make sure the butter is not overly soft. It\u2019s important to note the following 4 tips before you begin laminating in steps 8, 9, & 10: (1) It\u2019s OK if there are air bubbles in the dough because your rolling pin will pop them. (2) If the dough tears and butter is exposed, just sprinkle the exposed butter with flour. (3) If the dough is impossible to roll, try flipping it over. If it\u2019s still impossible to roll, cover and let it rest for 5 minutes before trying again, to let the gluten relax. And (4) Do not extend the refrigeration times, because the folded dough will begin to over-expand.\u00a0",
      "1st lamination: Remove dough from the refrigerator and set baking sheet aside. I like to keep the dough on the silicone baking mat when I\u2019m rolling it because the mat is nonstick. Working with the longer (14-inch) edge in front of you, line butter down the center of the dough, covering the center third of the dough. Fold one dough edge over on top of butter, and fold other edge on top of that (like folding a business letter). Pinch/seal the two short ends to enclose butter inside. Rotate dough so the long edge is horizontally in front of you. Lightly flour the top of the folded dough and, using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out to a 9\u00d712-inch (23x30cm) rectangle. Fold dough edges over on top like folding a business letter. Cover dough, place back on baking sheet, and refrigerate 20 minutes. Do not extend this time.",
      "2nd & 3rd laminations: Remove dough from the refrigerator and set baking sheet aside. Rotate dough so the long edge is horizontally in front of you. Lightly flour the top of the folded dough and, using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out to a 9\u00d712-inch rectangle. Fold dough edges over on top like folding a business letter. Rotate dough horizontally and repeat rolling out to 9\u00d712 inches and folding like a business letter. Cover dough, place back on baking sheet, and refrigerate 20 minutes. Do not extend this time.\u00a0",
      "Final lamination & shaping: Remove dough from the refrigerator and set baking sheet aside. Rotate dough so the long edge is horizontally in front of you. Lightly flour the top of the folded dough and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out to a 9\u00d712-inch rectangle. Fold dough edges over on top like folding a business letter. For the last time, rotate horizontally and roll out to 9\u00d712 inches. Working from a 9-inch side, roll dough up like you would roll up a jelly roll cake or cinnamon rolls. Place 9-inch log on a cutting board and cut into 5 even rolls (just eyeball it, they don\u2019t need to be perfectly even).",
      "2nd rise: Grease a 9\u00d75-inch (23x13cm) loaf pan. Place rolls, seam side down, in loaf pan. Cover tightly and allow to rise until slightly puffy, about 45\u201360 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to\u00a0350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).",
      "Whisk egg wash ingredients together. Generously brush risen rolls/loaf with egg wash. Bake loaf for 1 hour until golden brown on top, loosely tenting with aluminum foil after 25 minutes to prevent the top from over-browning before the center can cook. For an accurate test of doneness, the bread is done when an instant-read thermometer reads the center of the loaf as 195\u00b0F (90\u00b0C). (Tip:\u00a0Keep in mind that the bread will continue to cook for a few minutes as it cools.)",
      "Remove from the oven and place loaf pan on a wire rack. Cool for 30 minutes in the loaf pan. Run a knife around the edges of the pan to release the bread, and then remove bread from loaf pan and cool at least 15 more minutes directly on a wire rack before slicing and serving. (Bread tends to fall apart when sliced warm.) Bread may slightly deflate as it cools.",
      "Storing & freezing baked bread: Cover and store leftover croissant bread covered at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze it for up to 3 months and then thaw on the counter or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm up to your liking."

    "notes": [
      "Overnight Dough Instructions: After step 10, cover the shaped rolls in the loaf pan tightly and refrigerate for up to about 15 hours. At least 3 hours before you need the bread the next day, remove from the refrigerator, keep covered, and allow to rise on the counter for about 1\u20132 hours before baking. Alternatively, you can let the dough have its 1st rise (step 5) in the refrigerator overnight. Cover the dough tightly and place in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours. Remove from the refrigerator and allow the dough to fully rise for 2 more hours. Continue with step 6.",
      "Freezing Dough Instructions: The best way to successfully freeze and thaw this dough is after step 10. (Freezing/thawing before makes lamination difficult.) Cover and freeze shaped dough loaf (after step 10) for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator at least 3 hours before you need the bread, remove from the refrigerator, keep covered, and allow to rise on the counter for about 1\u20132 hours before baking.\u00a0",

      "Milk: Whole milk is ideal, but you can swap a lower-fat or non-dairy milk. Avoid nonfat milk.",
      "Yeast:\u00a0You can use active dry or instant yeast in this recipe. Follow all of the same instructions. If using active dry yeast, the rise times are usually *slightly* longer, but not much. Reference my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide\u00a0for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Butter: You can use either unsalted or salted butter in the dough, but be sure to use salted butter in the lamination step. The butter in the dough can be softened to room temperature, even overly softened is fine. However, the butter for the lamination does require your attention. It\u2019s important to make sure your lamination butter is not too cold/hard and you don\u2019t want it too greasy/soft either, because it needs to be about as pliable as the dough to incorporate into it. Sometimes I use a cooking thermometer just to check what temperature my butter and dough are for the lamination step, and it\u2019s ideal they both register *around* 60\u00b0F (15\u00b0C). Being about the same temperature helps the butter and the dough laminate easily.",
      "Can I Halve or Double This Recipe? No. Follow the dough recipe precisely as written. If 1 loaf is too much, freeze any extras. If you want 2 loaves, make the dough 2x separately.",
      "Can I Add a Filling? I tried jam and cinnamon sugar (1/4 teaspoon cinnamon with 2 Tbsp granulated sugar). The only one that worked fairly well was the cinnamon sugar. Anything wet like jam will create too much moisture and the bottom of the loaf doesn\u2019t bake very well. Plus, you need quite a lot to really taste it, which makes rolling up the dough fairly messy and difficult. You can absolutely try adding something dry like the cinnamon sugar, chopped nuts, or even chocolate chips! Spread a thin layer on the dough before rolling it up into a log in step 10."

      "Make the dough first: Place the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt into a large 8-cup capacity or higher food processor or, if you don\u2019t have a food processor, in a large bowl. Pulse or whisk until combined. Add butter and pulse or use a pastry cutter to manually cut in until coarse pea-sized crumbs form. See photo above for a visual. In 3 additions, pour in the milk and pulse or stir after each addition. After all the milk is added, pulse or stir more until the dough clumps up and comes together. If it\u2019s too dry, add 1 Tablespoon (15ml) of cold milk. Try not to overwork the dough. Pour onto a work surface lightly dusted with cocoa powder or all-purpose flour. Use your hands to form dough into a ball. Divide the dough in half and flatten each into 1-inch thick discs. Wrap each disc tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours and up to 5 days.",
      "Make the fudge filling soon after you prepare the dough: The fudge filling needs to cool and thicken, so that is why I recommend making it soon after you put the pastry dough in the refrigerator. Place chocolate, milk, and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir frequently as chocolate melts and mixture combines. Once melted, remove from heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract. Pour into a heatproof bowl, cover, and set aside at room temperature to cool and thicken. You want the consistency slightly thinner than peanut butter. Note: You can refrigerate the filling to thicken it, but it may become too thick and cold. If it\u2019s too thick, reheat in the microwave for a few seconds.",
      "Line 1 large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Make sure there is enough room in your refrigerator for the baking sheet because the shaped pastry pop tarts must chill for 15 minutes before baking.",
      "Roll out the chilled pie dough: Remove 1 of the dough discs from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 10 minutes to slightly warm up because it will be quite solid. (Keep the other in the refrigerator until step 5.) Lightly dust a work surface, rolling pin, and your hands with cocoa powder or all-purpose flour. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 9\u00d712-inch rectangle. Use gentle force with your rolling pin and use your hands to help keep the edges straight. You can watch me roll out the dough in the video below if you need a visual (2:23 mark). Visible specks of butter and fat in the dough are perfectly normal and expected. Trim the edges of the rectangle to straighten if needed. Cut rectangle into 3 equal strips and cut those into thirds for a total of 9 3\u00d74-inch rectangles. Use a ruler to help make this process easier and more accurate. Arrange the dough rectangles 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet and chill in the refrigerator as you roll out 2nd half of dough in the next step.",
      "Roll out the 2nd half of dough and cut into 9 3\u00d74-inch rectangles like you did with the 1st half of dough in step 4.",
      "Assemble the pastry tarts:\u00a0Remove 1st set of dough rectangles from the refrigerator. Using a pastry brush, brush edges of each of these 9 rectangles with egg wash. Spoon a heaping Tablespoon of filling into center of each. Lay the other set of pie dough rectangles on top of each and press your finger around the edges to slightly seal. Poke holes in the top pie crust with a fork or toothpick and then crimp with a fork to ensure no filling spills out (if it does, it\u2019s not a big deal). Refrigerate the shaped pastries uncovered for at least 15 minutes and up to 3 hours. This firms up the pastry and helps set its shape. (After chilling, feel free to carefully transfer the pastries to a new lined baking sheet if you don\u2019t want to bake them on the cold baking sheet.)",

Remove from the oven and allow pastries to cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Pastries taste best after completely cooling\u2013 they are very soft and rich when warm.",
      "Make the icing: In a medium saucepan over low heat or in a medium heatproof bowl using the microwave, warm butter and water together until butter has melted. Whisk mixture with the remaining icing ingredients. Cool icing for 15 minutes before spooning onto pastries. You can add the icing when the pastries are still warm, but again, they taste best after completely cooling. Immediately top with sprinkles, if using. Note: The longer the icing cools, the thicker it gets. If you let it cool too long before spooning on the pastries, the surface will stiffen up\u2013 whisking will bring it back together though. You can also reheat on the stove or in the microwave to thin out if needed.",

Baked and cooled pastries (with or without glaze) freeze well for up to 3 months. Thaw and heat in the microwave if desired. Do not heat in a toaster.",

      "Chocolate: For the best results, use a 4 ounce \u201cbaking chocolate\u201d bar found in the baking aisle. I prefer Bakers or Ghirardelli brands. You can use semi-sweet or even milk chocolate. Bittersweet makes a VERY dark and rich filling, so keep that in mind if you use a very dark chocolate. We have not tested it with white chocolate, so we can\u2019t guarantee results. You can also use chocolate chips and 2/3 cup (about 120g) would be the best amount to use.",
      "Milk: For best taste and texture, whole milk is ideal in the filling and pie crust. You can use lower fat or non dairy milk if needed, but avoid any milk that is fat free."

After baking, lightly dip the warm mini donut muffins in melted butter then dunk them in a bowl of powdered sugar. They\u2019re surprisingly easy to make and especially fun for kids!",
    "ingredients": [
      "1/3 cup (5 Tablespoons; 72g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
      "1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar",
      "1 large egg, at room temperature",
      "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "1 and 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)*",
      "1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder",
      "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
      "1/2 teaspoon salt",
      "1/2 cup (120ml) milk, at room temperature*",
      "3 Tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter",
      "1 cup (120g) confectioners\u2019 sugar"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Spray mini muffin pan with cooking spray. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until creamy and combined, about 2 minutes. On medium speed, beat in the egg and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula and beat again as needed to combine. (Mixture may appear curdled\u2013 that\u2019s ok.) Add the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Beat on low speed and with the mixer running, slowly pour in the milk and beat on low until combined. The batter will be thick.",
      "Spoon batter into mini muffin wells filling 2/3 full.\u00a0",
      "Bake for 12-14 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or when lightly poked, the donut muffin bounces back. Remove from the oven and cool in the muffin pan for 5 minutes.",
      "As the donut muffins cool, prepare the topping. Melt butter in a heatproof bowl in the microwave or melt over low heat on the stove. Pour the confectioners\u2019 sugar in a medium bowl. Lightly dunk a muffin (they can still be warm at this point) in the melted butter. Submerge in the confectioners\u2019 sugar to coat the surface generously. Set upright on cooling rack and repeat with remaining donut muffins.",
      "Donut muffins taste best eaten on the same day. Cover leftover donuts and store at room temperature for up to 1 day or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: It\u2019s best to freeze the donut muffins before coating in butter and confectioners\u2019 sugar. After cooling completely, place donut muffins in a freezer-friendly container and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature before coating. If needed, you can freeze after coating the donut muffins but the confectioners\u2019 sugar coating may get a little moist as they thaw.\u00a0",

      "Flour: You can use white whole wheat flour in this recipe instead of all-purpose flour. I do not recommend using regular whole wheat flour.",
      "Milk: You can use any milk, dairy or non dairy, in this recipe.",
      "Can I Make These in a Donut Pan? Absolutely. If you have a regular donut pan, you can use this batter to make about 10 regular baked powdered sugar donuts. Fill donut pan wells 2/3 full with batter. The bake time is similar to the mini donut muffins or even a little shorter. Keep your eye on them. If the surface bounces back when lightly poked with your finger, they\u2019re done. I also have a recipe for powdered sugar donuts in one of my cookbooks, but this version is a little cakier and yields more.",
      "Can I Make These in a Regular Muffin Pan? Yes, you can use a standard 12-count muffin pan for to make 10 donut muffins. Follow these instructions: Spray muffin pan with cooking spray. Do not use muffin liners because these will stick. Spoon batter to fill each muffin well. Bake at 425\u00b0F (218\u00b0C) for 5 minutes. Keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce temperature to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) and bake for an additional 13-17 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Continue with the recipe above.",
      "Confectioners\u2019 Sugar: Confectioners\u2019 sugar and powdered sugar are used interchangeably in recipes and are mostly the same thing, however confectioners\u2019 sugar typically contains a little starch to prevent it from caking. You can use either in this recipe."

      "Applesauce: It\u2019s best to use unsweetened applesauce. If using sweetened, slightly reduce the maple syrup down to 1/4 cup (60ml). You can use homemade or store-bought applesauce and the consistency doesn\u2019t make a difference\u2013 use thick, thin, smooth, or chunky. Applesauce with cinnamon is also a great choice, but if you don\u2019t want too much cinnamon flavor, I would slightly reduce the cinnamon in the recipe.",

      "Raisins/Add-Ins: Feel free to leave the muffins plain, but they\u2019re excellent with add-ins such as raisins, 3/4 cup (about 110g) dried cranberries, 1 cup (about 120g) chopped walnuts or pecans, 1\u00a0and 1/2 cups (165g) peeled & chopped apples (about 2 medium apples such as Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Gala, Pink Lady), or 3/4 cup (about 135g) chocolate chips.",
      "Initial High Temperature: The hot burst of air will spring up the top of the muffin quickly, then the inside of the muffin can bake for the remainder of the time. This helps the muffins rise nice and tall.",
      "Room Temperature Ingredients: It\u2019s best if any cold ingredients are brought to room temperature before starting. The coconut oil will slightly solidify if other ingredients are too cold and you may notice greasy oily pockets in the baked muffins.",

Though the dough rises and is ready in about 2 hours, I strongly recommend refrigerating it for at least 6 hours so your English muffins have better flavor. For best success, review recipe notes, video tutorial, and step-by-step photos (below) before starting.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) milk, warmed to about 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C)*",
      "2 teaspoons (6g)\u00a0instant\u00a0or\u00a0active dry yeast*",

      "2 cups + 3 Tablespoons (280g) bread flour or all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)*",
      "cornmeal or semolina flour for handling dough (at least 1/2 cup (60g))"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the dough: In a large un-greased mixing bowl, whisk the warm milk, yeast, and honey together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/rubber spatula. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula is a better choice.*",
      "Add the butter, egg, salt, whole wheat flour, and 1 cup (about 130g) of the bread flour. Whisk to combine. Add 1 more cup (130g) bread flour and beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Dough will be extremely sticky and like a loose batter. Add remaining flour, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, and then beat on low speed for 1 minute to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again and then fold the dough together a few times with your rubber spatula. Do not be tempted to add more flour. It\u2019s supposed to be very sticky.",
      "Cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and set on the counter at room temperature. Allow to rise until double in size, about 2 hours. The dough will be sticking to the sides of the bowl and have a lot of air bubbles. You can continue with step 4 immediately, but for absolute best flavor and texture, I strongly recommend letting this risen dough rest in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours. Place covered dough in the refrigerator for 6-24 hours. The dough will very slightly puff up during this time, but may begin to deflate after 24 hours.",
      "Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. One is for the shaped uncooked muffins and the 2nd is for baking the muffins.",
      "Shape the muffins: Remove cold dough from the refrigerator\u2013 no need to bring it to room temperature. Sprinkle a little cornmeal/semolina on the surface of the dough and all over your hands. Have more nearby and use whenever things begin getting super sticky. Grab a small handful of dough, about 1/3 cup of dough or 2.5-3 ounces if you have a kitchen scale, and gently form into a 1-inch thick disc that\u2019s about 3.5 inches in diameter\u2013 doesn\u2019t need to be perfect\u2013 and place onto lined baking sheet. You\u2019re basically shaping them as you\u2019d shape hamburger patties. Repeat with remaining dough for a total of about 12. Sprinkle the tops of the shaped discs lightly with more cornmeal and cover to rest for 20 minutes. (Do not extend this time or the muffins will puff too much.)",
      "Meanwhile, as the shaped muffins rest, get your stove ready. Heat a griddle to medium heat or about 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C) or use a large skillet or cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. If your griddle/skillet/cast iron is nonstick or seasoned, there\u2019s no need to grease it. If not nonstick, grease with a little butter. Once greased pan/griddle is heated, sprinkle lightly with cornmeal/semolina flour and begin to cook the muffins in the next step.",
      "Read this entire step before starting to cook the muffins. Using a flat spatula, carefully transfer however many muffins can fit on your pan/griddle with at least 2 inches between each because muffins will puff up as they cook. Gently flatten them around the edges with the back of your spatula, being careful to not flatten too hard which would deflate them. Cook for 7-8 minutes and then flip over, gently flatten again, and cook for another 7-8 minutes. (No need to grease or sprinkle more cornmeal/semolina when flipping.) This cook time is a general guideline because griddles/stoves/pans can heat differently and/or unevenly. You want to cook until golden brown on each side and edges seem set. If muffins seem to be over-browning quickly, slightly turn down the stove\u2019s heat. And, as the muffins cook, you can start preheating the oven (next step). Transfer cooked muffins to the unused prepared baking sheet.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).",
      "Bake for 8-11 minutes or until an instant read thermometer reads the center as 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C). If you don\u2019t have an instant read thermometer, cut a muffin open after 8 minutes and if it\u2019s still extra doughy in the center, return to the oven until baked through. I usually bake them for at least 10 minutes.",
      "Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheet before slicing and handling. To preserve the craggy texture, slice the honey wheat English muffins in half using a serrated knife. Or you can slice around the edges with a regular sharp knife and then pry the two halves apart with a fork. Toast halves in the toaster if desired (taste best that way!) and serve warm with desired toppings such as butter, honey butter, jam, apple butter, or other topping of choice. Muffins can also be used for breakfast sandwiches or eggs Benedict.",

      "Make Ahead Instructions: Prepare the dough through step 3 and let the dough rest in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before continuing with step 4. No need to bring dough to room temperature before you begin to shape the muffins\u2013 cold dough is easier to work with!",
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Freezing: Baked English muffins freeze well up to 3 months. You can freeze in a large container or freezer bag or wrap individually in plastic wrap. Thaw by defrosting in the microwave or setting out on the counter to come to room temperature. For best taste and texture, slice and toast them after thawing. You can also freeze the English muffins after they come off the stove (after step 7). Cool completely and then freeze in a large container or freezer bag or wrap individually in plastic wrap for up to 3 months. Thaw and then continue with step 8.",

      "Milk: Whole milk is great, but you can use any milk\u2013 non dairy or dairy + any milk fat.",
      "Yeast: You can use active-dry or instant yeast. The instructions are the same no matter which you use. Note that 2 teaspoons (6g) is less than 1 standard packet.",
      "Honey: You can substitute the honey with granulated sugar, but reduce it down to 2 Tablespoons (25g).",
      "Flour: This ratio of whole wheat to white flour is best. I do not recommend using more whole wheat flour because the texture of the English muffins will change. For the white flour, you can use bread flour or all-purpose flour. I recommend bread flour for the best texture.",
      "Adapted from King Arthur Baking. I reduced the flour, reduced the butter and switched to melted, used some whole wheat flour, swapped sugar for honey, and reduced the milk."

      "Bake for 40-55 minutes. Baking times vary greatly depending on the pan you\u2019re using. A thick ceramic pan (as pictured) will take longer than a metal springform pan. Keep an eye on yours. The cake is done when the edges are browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If you find the top of the cake is browning too quickly in the oven, loosely cover it with aluminum foil.",
      "Remove the cake from the oven and set on a wire rack to cool for 10-15 minutes.",

Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature to serve or you can slightly warm by baking at 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) for 15 minutes. Drizzle icing on cake, if it\u2019s plain, before serving.",
      "Baking Pan to Use (affiliate link): Use a baking dish that holds 2 quarts, such as a 9-inch square baking dish, 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan, or an 11\u00d77 inch pan. I do not recommend a 9-inch regular round cake pan because there is so much batter and even though it will fit, the batter will rise quite high and won\u2019t bake evenly. The pictured red ruffled baking dish is by the brand Emile Henry and comes in a set with others.",
      "Sour Cream: If you don\u2019t have sour cream, you can use plain regular or Greek yogurt instead. I don\u2019t suggest subbing the sour cream with a liquid.",
      "Cranberries: If using dried instead of fresh or frozen, reduce down to 1 cup (140g) dried cranberries.",
      "Optional Icing (affiliate link): The icing is optional. Feel free to skip it completely and leave the cake plain. Or you can dust the warm cake with confectioners\u2019 sugar using a\u00a0fine mesh sieve."

      "Make the dough: Warm the milk and butter together over the stove or in the microwave. Warm the two together until the butter is *just* melted. You want the mixture lukewarm (105\u00b0F (41\u00b0C)-115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C)), not scorching hot. Set aside. Whisk the pumpkin puree, sugar, nutmeg, and salt together in a large bowl or in the bowl of your stand mixer. Whisk in the warmed milk/butter, egg, and yeast until combined. Using the dough hook or paddle attachment on low speed or mixing by hand using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, mix in 1 cup of flour. Mix for 1 minute, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add 1 and 2/3 cups more flour and beat for 1 more minute.",
      "Knead the dough:\u00a0Keep the dough in the mixer and beat on low speed for an additional 3 minutes or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 3 minutes.",
      "1st Rise:\u00a0Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to\u00a0Where Should Dough Rise?\u00a0in my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch square baking dish, 9-inch round baking dish, 9\u00d713-inch baking dish, or 11\u00d77-inch baking dish. This recipe yields 10-12 rolls and they can fit into any of those size pans.",
      "Roll out the dough:\u00a0Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 10\u00d714-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you\u2019re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier.",
      "Add the filling: Spread softened butter evenly on top of the rolled-out dough. Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and spices into a small bowl. Sprinkle all over the top. Roll it up tightly. Using a very sharp knife, cut into 10-12 even rolls. Arrange rolls in the prepared pan.",

      "Freezing Instructions: Baked rolls can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and warm up before enjoying. You can also freeze the unbaked rolls and here\u2019s how: bake the rolls in step 9 for only about 10 minutes. Cool completely, and then cover tightly and freeze.

      "Milk: For super soft rolls, I recommend whole milk. Nondairy or lower fat milks work too, but the rolls may not taste as rich and fluffy.",
      "Yeast: You can use active dry or instant yeast in this recipe. Follow all of the same instructions. If using active dry yeast, the rise times are usually *slightly* longer, but not much. Reference my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide\u00a0for answers to common yeast FAQs.",

      "Slice and cut the bread into 1-inch cubes. Let the cubed bread sit out uncovered for a few hours or up to 1 day. (If you don\u2019t have enough time, see Bread\u00a0note below.)",
      "Grease a 9\u00d713-inch baking dish (or any 3.5-4 quart baking dish) or spray with nonstick spray. Spread cubes of bread in the dish.",
      "Whisk pumpkin, brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, eggs, milk, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Pour evenly over bread.",
      "Cover the pan tightly and place in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours and up to 1 day. This gives the bread a chance to soak up the pumpkin custard and is a key step in this recipe.",
      "Make and refrigerate the crumb topping too: Mix the brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon together. Add the cold butter and using a pastry cutter or fork, cut butter into the brown sugar mixture until pea-size crumbles form. You can also use your hands to mix it together. Stir in the pecans. Cover and refrigerate (separately, do not add to soaking casserole) until ready to use in step 7. Can be refrigerated for just 15 minutes or up to 1 day. The colder it is, the less likely it will sink down and get lost in the casserole.",
      "Remove casserole from the refrigerator and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).",
      "Sprinkle crumb topping evenly over casserole and bake uncovered for 20 minutes, and then cover with aluminum foil and bake for an additional 25-35 minutes or until center appears set and is no longer runny. The total time this casserole takes is 45-55 minutes.",
      "Remove from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before serving. Casserole deflates slightly as it cools. Feel free to drizzle maple syrup on top of entire casserole or on individual servings.",
      "Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for 2-3 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: You can prepare the casserole up to 1 day in advance before adding the crumb topping, see step 4. You can prepare the crumb topping separately 1 day in advance, cover tightly, and store in the refrigerator. Sprinkle over the soaked bread right before baking. For freezing, prepare the recipe through step 3 and freeze for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, make the crumb topping, sprinkle on top, and then bake the casserole as instructed. You can also freeze the leftover baked and cooled casserole for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator, then reheat to your liking in the microwave or cover and bake in a 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) until warm throughout, at least 20 minutes.",

      "Bread: Crusty, somewhat stale bread is best for French toast casseroles. When all is cut into cubes, you\u2019ll have around 12 cups (slightly more or less is fine). If you\u2019re in a rush and don\u2019t have time to let the bread sit out as instructed in step 1, spread the cubes in a single layer on baking sheet and bake in a 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) oven for 10 minutes.",
      "Pumpkin Pie Spice:\u00a0You can find pumpkin pie spice in the baking aisle of most grocery stores or make your own homemade pumpkin pie spice. If you don\u2019t have either and want to use individual spices, use 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon each ground cloves and ground allspice. You also need cinnamon for the topping.",
      "Milk: Whole milk is best because it produces a rich casserole that isn\u2019t too heavy. You can use lower fat or nondairy milks in a pinch. Half-and-half could work, but casserole will be quite heavy.",
      "Slow Cooker: Keep in mind that when cooked in the slow cooker, the casserole doesn\u2019t have quite as much texture compared to baking in the oven. Step 1 is especially important if you are using the slow cooker. Instructions: Follow step 1. In step 2, grease your slow cooker insert and spread cubes of bread inside. Follow steps 3, 4, and 5. Let slow cooker insert completely come to room temperature, and then sprinkle crumb topping over soaked bread. Place slow cooker insert into the base, cover with lid, and cook on high for 2.5-3.5 hours, or on low for 4-5 hours. Casserole is done when center appears set and is no longer runny.",
      "Individual Cups/Muffin Pan:\u00a0We haven\u2019t tested this option, but let us know if you try it!",
      "Half Recipe: This recipe can easily be halved in a 9-inch square baking pan. The total bake time will be shorter, around 30-35 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil after 15 minutes of baking.",
      "Nut Free: Leave out the pecans if needed.",
      "Cream Cheese Version: Follow step 1 above. Beat 8 ounces (224g) brick-style cream cheese that\u2019s softened to room temperature, 2 Tablespoons (15g) confectioners\u2019 sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract together until smooth. In step 2, layer half of the bread into greased casserole dish. Drop spoonfuls of cream cheese mixture all over the bread. Top with remaining bread. Continue with step 3 above."

Cook while stirring occasionally for 5-8 minutes or until figs are soft and have absorbed some of the liquid. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Cool for 5 minutes, and then transfer to a food processor or blender and puree until there are no more chunks (fig seeds will not break down). Set aside. Makes *about* 1 and 1/4 cups filling.",

Begin whisking to combine and once the mixture becomes too thick, switch to a spoon or rubber spatula to bring the ingredients together.

There are also Black Mission dried figs, which aren\u2019t quite as large as Smyrna figs. You can use either variety. Do not use fresh figs in this recipe. Dried figs can be quite small and shriveled or you can find plumper rehydrated figs. Either will work here because we are cooking the chopped dried figs for the filling.",
      "Fig Jam: Readers have asked about using fig jam. I have not tested it to be certain, but I can\u2019t see why that wouldn\u2019t work instead of the homemade filling. You\u2019ll need about 1 and 1/4 cups jam.",
      "Oats: Whole oats are best, but you can use quick oats if needed. The crust/topping will just be a little more crumbly. (Don\u2019t be tempted to reduce the flour, though\u2013 it may turn out greasy.) Use a 1:1 swap from whole oats to quick oats.",

    "description": "These homemade berry turnovers use a shortcut version of traditional puff pastry dough that\u2019s often referred to as rough puff pastry. Each bite is mostly flaky dough with just a touch of berry filling. Make sure the butter is very cold before beginning the dough.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 teaspoon cornstarch",
      "1 teaspoon warm water",
      "1 cup (about 150g) mixed berries (I use 1/2 cup blueberries, 1/4 cup halved blackberries, 1/4 cup chopped strawberries)",
      "1 and 1/2 Tablespoons (18g) granulated sugar",
      "1 teaspoon lemon juice",
      "1 and 1/3 cups (166g) all-purpose flour\u00a0(spooned & leveled), plus more for generously flouring hands, surface, and dough",
      "1 teaspoon granulated sugar",
      "1/2 teaspoon salt",
      "3/4 cup (12 Tbsp; 170g) unsalted butter, very cold and cubed",
      "6\u20138 Tablespoons (90-120ml) ice cold water",
      "1\u00a0large\u00a0egg*",
      "2 Tablespoons (30ml)\u00a0milk",
      "optional: coarse sugar for topping",
      "optional: vanilla icing"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Make the filling first so it has time to cool: Whisk the cornstarch and water together until all the cornstarch has dissolved. (I just use a fork to mix\u2013very easy.) Place the berries, sugar, cornstarch mixture, and lemon juice into a small saucepan over medium heat. Using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, stir the mixture as it cooks. Break up some of the berries as you stir. Bring it to a simmer and allow to simmer for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove pan from the heat and cool completely. The mixture will thicken as it cools. Once cool, filling can be covered and refrigerated for up to 5 days before using. Makes 3/4 cup of filling.",
      "Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Place the cold and cubed butter on top. Gently toss the flour and butter together with your hands, and then briefly rub the butter into the flour to begin combining them, as you can see in the video tutorial below. You do not want to break down the butter too much in this step. This step is only possible if the butter is very cold because if the butter is warm, you\u2019ll end up with paste. I do not recommend a food processor, pastry cutter, or mixer for this step because it will break down the butter too much.",
      "At this point, the butter is still in large cubes/chunks. Begin adding the ice cold water 1 Tablespoon (15ml) at a time until dough forms 1 large shaggy clump in your bowl. Use your hands to toss the mixture together after you add each Tablespoon. (I usually start with 2 Tablespoons (30ml) of water before I begin tossing together.) You can use a spatula or spoon for tossing, but I really do recommend your hands so you get a good feel of the dough. As the dough begins to hydrate after about 4 Tablespoons (60ml) of water, you can start lightly squeezing or clumping the dough together with your hands to help bring it together. Mixture will still be very shaggy, as you can see in the video and photos below. If your dough feels sticky and wet before adding 6 Tablespoons of water, your butter was likely too warm\u2014you can continue with the recipe, but the dough will not be as flaky.",
      "Pour the shaggy clump of dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. There will still be large chunks of butter at this point and that\u2019s a good thing. Begin patting the dough down with lightly floured hands until it\u2019s 3/4 \u2013 1 inch thick, about a 5\u00d78 inch rectangle. Fold the dough into thirds as if you were folding a business letter. Use your hands to gently flatten and smooth out any cracks in your dough. Wrap it up tightly in plastic wrap, parchment paper, or aluminum foil, or place into any tightly sealed container.",
      "1st refrigeration: Refrigerate dough for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.",
      "Roll & Fold: Take the dough out of the refrigerator to begin the \u201crolling and folding\u201d process. If the dough chilled for longer than about 3 hours, it\u2019s likely very stiff so let it rest for about 5 minutes before you begin rolling. Lightly flour a work surface. The dough gets sticky, so make sure you have more flour nearby as you roll and fold. Use your hands to gently flatten the dough into a small square. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 6 inch wide and 12 inch tall rectangle that\u2019s 1/2 inch thick. The exact dimensions are not important, but the thickness is. As you roll, it\u2019s best to flip the dough over once or twice to make sure it\u2019s not sticking to your work surface. Lightly flour your work surface as needed. Fold the rectangle into thirds as if it were a business letter. (See photos and video tutorial.) Turn it clockwise or counter clockwise and roll it out into a 6\u00d712 inch 1/2 inch thick rectangle again. Then, fold into thirds again. Turn it clockwise or counter clockwise. You\u2019ll repeat rolling and folding 4 more times for a total of 6 times.",
      "2nd Refrigeration: Wrap up/seal tightly and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes and up to 24 hours. You can also freeze the dough at this point. See freezing instructions.",
      "Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Rimmed baking sheets are best because butter may leak from the dough as it bakes. If you don\u2019t have rimmed baking sheets, when it\u2019s time to preheat the oven, place another baking sheet on the oven rack below to catch any butter that may drip.",
      "Take the dough out of the refrigerator to begin the shaping steps. Lightly flour a work surface. Using a rolling pin, roll dough into a 12-inch square. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, cut into 9 4-inch squares. Transfer squares to prepared baking sheets. (4 on one, 5 on the other.)",
      "Spoon 1 heaping Tablespoon of filling into the center of each square. Fold one corner over the filling to make a triangle. If some chunky filling has seeped out, use a fork to push it back in if you can. Using a fork, crimp the edges of the turnovers together to seal. If the dough has become too warm and sticky to crimp, refrigerate the triangles for 10 minutes. You want to make sure you have a tightly sealed turnover to help prevent filling from spilling out in the oven.",
      "Chill the shaped turnovers in the refrigerator, covered or uncovered, for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour (or freeze, see freezing instructions below). You can preheat the oven and make the egg wash (next steps) as they finish up chilling.",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).",
      "Egg Wash: Whisk the egg and milk together. Brush on each turnover. Cut 3 slits into the tops of each to allow steam to escape. If desired, sprinkle with coarse sugar.",
      "Bake for 22-25 minutes or until golden brown on top and around the edges. Some butter may leak from the dough, that\u2019s completely normal and expected. Feel free to remove the baking sheets from the oven halfway through baking and brush the dough with any of the leaking butter, then place back in the oven to finish baking. (That\u2019s what I do!)",
      "Remove baked turnovers from the oven. Cool for at least 5 minutes before icing/serving. Centers will be hot.",
      "Drizzle with vanilla icing\u00a0if desired.",
      "Cover leftover iced or un-iced turnovers and store at room temperature for 1 day or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Or you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Thaw before serving. Before enjoying, feel free to reheat leftover iced or un-iced turnovers in the microwave for a few seconds until warmed."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead\u00a0& Freezing Instructions: You can make the filling up to 5 days ahead of time. See the end of step 1. For the dough, prepare as instructed in steps 2-4. At this point the dough can be refrigerated up to 24 hours. You can also prepare the dough through step 6. At this point the dough can be refrigerated for up to another 24 hours. During or after this second chilling time, you could also freeze the dough for up to 1 month. (I don\u2019t recommend freezing the dough before the rolling and folding step.) Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then continue with step 8. In step 11, you can cover and freeze the shaped turnovers for up to 1 month. Thaw in the refrigerator, then continue with step 12.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Glass Mixing Bowls | Whisk | Small Saucepan | Rolling Pin | Baking Sheets | Silicone Baking Mats or Parchment Paper | Pizza Cutter or Sharp Knife | Pastry Brush",
      "Mixed Berry Filling: The ratios I list above are what I find work best, but feel free to substitute in raspberries. You can use all blueberries, all halved blackberries, or all chopped strawberries instead. Raspberries are very fragile and juicy, so I don\u2019t recommend using all raspberries for this filling. You can use frozen berries (don\u2019t thaw) with no changes to the recipe.",
      "Double Batch: The filling and dough recipe can easily be doubled. In step 4, make sure you\u2019re patting the dough to be about 3/4 \u2013 1 inch thick. In step 6, roll out to 1/2 inch thick. The dimensions in both of these steps doesn\u2019t matter much, but the thickness does. In step 9, divide dough in half before rolling out into 2 separate 12-inch squares. Continue with the recipe as written.",
      "Other Uses For This Dough: After the dough has chilled in step 7, it\u2019s ready to shape however you want. This recipe makes around 1 pound of dough, which is enough for one 9-inch tart or pie. If your pie or tart recipe requires par-baking with pie weights, I still recommend using them with this dough. I would follow all of the same instructions in your recipe, just switching out the dough to this. After step 7, roll it out to a 12 inch circle and use it as the topping for this skillet pot pie. Or after step 7, roll it out to a 12 inch circle and use it as the bottom crust for quiche\u2014par-bake and dock the crust with a fork as instructed in the quiche recipe. Or after step 7, roll it out to a 10\u00d714 inch rectangle and follow the recipe for honey pear tart.",
      "Chilling shaped turnovers: Chilling the shaped turnovers in the refrigerator before baking them helps them maintain their shape in the oven. Remember, cold pastry dough is best. I usually refrigerate them for 15 minutes as the oven preheats. If you\u2019re nervous to chill the baking sheets in the refrigerator then bake them (which can cause warping), you have two other options. You can simply assemble the turnovers on parchment paper or silicone baking mats, lift the parchment/baking mat as a whole and place on another baking sheet or directly onto a shelf in the refrigerator. After chilling, carefully lift up and place the entire parchment/baking mat onto the baking sheets for baking. Or you can use a thin spatula and very carefully transfer the assembled unbaked pastries to a large plate to chill.",
      "Egg Wash: An egg wash promises that golden sheen on your pastries. You can skip the egg and use a total of 3 Tablespoons (45ml) milk (any kind, dairy or nondairy) instead."

      "Sour Cream: Use full fat sour cream. In a pinch, you can replace it with plain yogurt. (Full fat Greek style or regular yogurt would be best.)",
      "Oil: For best taste and texture, use vegetable oil. In a pinch, you can replace with canola oil or olive oil. The muffins can taste greasy with melted coconut oil, but if you try it, it\u2019s imperative the other ingredients are room temperature so the coconut oil doesn\u2019t solidify as you mix the batter together.",
      "Milk: Whole milk is best. 2%, 1%, or nondairy milk work in a pinch. Do not use nonfat milk. Don\u2019t use buttermilk. (You could use buttermilk if replacing both the sour cream AND milk, but the muffins taste a little spongy that way. Best to use sour cream and whole milk.)",

      "1/2 teaspoon\u00a0pure vanilla extract"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the dough:\u00a0Whisk the warm milk, 2 Tablespoons sugar, and the yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/rubber spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula is a better choice.*",
      "Add the remaining sugar, the butter, eggs, salt, and 1 cup (about 130g) of flour and beat on medium speed for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add 3 cups (about 400g)  flour, switch the mixer down to low speed, and beat until a soft dough forms and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Dough will be very soft, but not overly sticky. Beat in 2-3 more Tablespoons of flour if dough seems very sticky. Avoid adding more flour than you need.",
      "Knead the dough:\u00a0Keep the dough in the mixer and beat on low speed for an additional 3 minutes or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 3 minutes.",
      "1st Rise:\u00a0Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to\u00a0Where Should Dough Rise?\u00a0in my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Grease the bottom and sides of a metal or glass 9\u00d713 inch baking dish or line with parchment paper.",
      "Roll out the dough:\u00a0Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 10\u00d716 inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you\u2019re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier.",
      "For the filling: Mix all of the filling ingredients together except for the chopped chocolate/chocolate chips. The softer the butter is, the easier it is to mix. (Microwave it for a few seconds to soften if needed.) Spread mixture all over the dough. Sprinkle chopped chocolate/chocolate chips evenly on top. Tightly roll up the dough to form a 16-inch-long log. If some filling spills out, sprinkle it on top of the roll. With an extra sharp knife, cut into 12 even rolls, between 1-1.5 inches each. Arrange in the prepared baking pan.",
      "2nd Rise:\u00a0Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. (Or use the overnight option below.)",
      "Preheat the oven to\u00a0350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Bake rolls for about 25-28 minutes or until they are lightly browned on top. After about 15 minutes, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly and baking unevenly. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes as you make the icing.",
      "Make the icing: Warm the cream on the stove until barely simmering or warm it in the microwave for 15-30 seconds. Whisk espresso powder into the warm cream, then whisk in the confectioners\u2019 sugar and vanilla extract until combined. Drizzle the icing over the warm rolls and serve immediately.",
      "Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Overnight:\u00a0To prepare the night before serving, prepare the rolls through step 7. Cover the rolls tightly and refrigerate for 8-12 hours. (16 hours max. 8-12 hours is best, but 16 hours is OK if absolutely needed.\u00a0Do not exceed 16 hours.) The next morning, remove from the refrigerator and allow to rise on the counter for 1-2 hours before continuing with step 9.",
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Freezing: Baked rolls can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and warm up before enjoying. You can also freeze the unbaked rolls and here\u2019s how: bake the rolls in step 9 for only about 10 minutes. Cool completely, then cover tightly and freeze. To serve, take the rolls out of the freezer and place in the refrigerator overnight to thaw. Once thawed, finish baking them for about 20 minutes.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Electric Stand Mixer (or Glass Mixing Bowl with Wooden Spoon/Rubber Spatula) | 9\u00d713-inch Baking Pan | Rolling Pin | Cooling Rack",
      "Milk: Use whole milk for the best, richest tasting dough. You could also use buttermilk. 2%, 1%, or nondairy milk work in a pinch. Do not use nonfat milk.",
      "Yeast: Make sure you use 1 Tablespoon of yeast, which is a little more than 1 standard packet. You can use active dry or instant yeast in this recipe. Follow all of the same instructions. If using active dry yeast, the rise times are usually *slightly* longer, but not much. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide\u00a0for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Best Flour to Use:\u00a0For best texture, I recommend bread flour. The same amount of all-purpose flour works and the rolls will still be wonderfully rich and soft. The rolls are a little more chewy and flaky when using bread flour.",
      "Chocolate: I usually use and recommend one 4 ounce (113g) baking chocolate bar, such as Ghirardelli or Bakers 4 ounce bars sold in the baking aisle. Chopped fine, this is about 3/4 cup. You can use semi-sweet or bittersweet. Avoid white chocolate or milk chocolate because the rolls will be overly sweet. You can use about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips, mini or regular size, instead. Chocolate chips weigh a little more, so use 135g if you are using a scale.",
      "Heavy Cream & Espresso Powder: In first part of the icing recipe, we are essentially making a creamy and very strong espresso liquid by mixing warm cream with espresso powder. (Make sure you use instant espresso powder, which is typically sold as simply \u201cespresso powder.\u201d) Feel free to use 3 Tablespoons of very strong brewed espresso or black coffee instead. Mix icing ingredients together, then add 1 more Tablespoon brewed espresso or black coffee to thin out if needed/desired.",
      "Half Batch: You can halve this recipe by halving all of the ingredients and using an 8 or 9 inch square or round pan. The 1st dough rise time may be a bit shorter. Roll the dough out to (approximately) a 7\u00d710 inch rectangle. Roll up into a 10 inch log, then cut into 6 rolls. 2nd dough rise time will be about the same. Bake time is a few minutes shorter."

Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/rubber spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula is a better choice.*",
      "On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won\u2019t really be mixing into the mixture, so don\u2019t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it\u2019s fully incorporated before adding the next. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft.",
      "Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if you used the paddle) and beat on low speed for an additional 5 minutes OR knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes. If kneading by hand, keep a small bowl of flour nearby to continually flour your hands, as the dough can be quite sticky. After kneading, poke the dough with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.",
      "1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise?\u00a0in my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Grease the bottom and sides of a metal or glass 9\u00d713-inch baking dish or line with parchment paper.",
      "Roll out the dough: Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 12\u00d718-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you\u2019re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier.",
      "For the filling: Spread the softened butter all over the dough. The softer the butter is, the easier it is to spread in this step. (Microwave it for a few seconds to soften if needed.) In a small bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon together. Sprinkle evenly over the butter. Tightly roll up the dough to form an 18-inch-long log. If some filling spills out, sprinkle it on top of the roll. With an extra sharp knife, cut into 12 even rolls, about 1.5 inches each. Arrange in the prepared baking pan.",
      "2nd Rise: Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until puffy, about 1 hour. (Or use the overnight option in the Notes below.)",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).",
      "Bake for about 25\u201328 minutes or until they are lightly browned on top. After about 15 minutes, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes as you make the icing.",
      "Make the icing: In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth and creamy. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, cream/milk, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 1 minute. Spread the icing over the warm rolls and serve immediately.",
      "Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Overnight: To prepare the night before serving, prepare the rolls through step 7. Cover the rolls tightly and refrigerate for 8\u201312 hours. (16 hours max. 8\u201312 hours is best, but 16 hours is OK if absolutely needed. Do not exceed 16 hours.) The next morning, remove from the refrigerator and allow to rise on the counter for 1\u20132 hours before continuing with step 9.",
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Freezing: Baked rolls can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and warm up before enjoying. You can also freeze the unbaked rolls and here\u2019s how: bake the rolls in step 9 for only about 10 minutes. Cool completely, then cover tightly and freeze. To serve, take the rolls out of the freezer and place in the refrigerator overnight to thaw. Once thawed, finish baking them for about 15\u201320 minutes.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Stand Mixer | Rolling Pin | 9\u00d713-Inch Glass Baking Pan or Metal Baking Pan | Glass Mixing Bowls",
      "Milk: I recommend using whole milk for the best, richest-tasting dough. You could also use buttermilk. Reduced-fat, low-fat, or nondairy milk works in a pinch. Do not use nonfat milk.",
      "Yeast: You can use active dry or instant yeast in this recipe. Follow all of the same instructions. If using active dry yeast, the rise times are usually slightly longer. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Other Icing Options: Instead of cream cheese icing, you can top the warm rolls with vanilla icing, the brown sugar icing from these pumpkin donuts, maple icing from maple cinnamon rolls, or even the caramel icing from apple cinnamon rolls.",
      "Gluten Free: We have not tested this recipe with gluten-free flour, so we are unsure of the results."

Once the butter has melted, remove from heat and whisk in the sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar and maple extract. Taste. Add a pinch of salt if desired. Cool for 2-3 minutes, then dip each donut into the icing. The icing quickly thickens, so feel free to place it back over heat as you dip.

      "Milk & Yogurt: Whole milk is best, but you can use lower fat or even nondairy milk in a pinch\u2014the donuts won\u2019t taste as moist or rich. I recommend Greek yogurt or full-fat sour cream. I usually use low fat Greek yogurt, which is pretty thick. Regular low fat (or full fat) yogurt works too. If you\u2019d like to use buttermilk, substitute it for both the milk and sour cream (1/2 cup/120ml total). All cold ingredients should be brought to room temperature before using, otherwise the butter will solidify.",

    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preliminary note: To help guarantee success, I recommend reading through the recipe before beginning. I also detail this recipe in the separate pastry dough post. Do not use an electric mixer for this dough. It\u2019s best if the dough is folded together with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula since it is so sticky. There is very minimal mixing required.",
      "Make the Pastry Dough: Whisk the warm water, yeast, and 1 Tablespoon (6g) of sugar together in a large bowl. Cover and allow to rest until foamy on top, about 5 minutes. If the surface doesn\u2019t have bubbles on top or look foamy after 15 minutes (it should if the yeast isn\u2019t expired), start over with a fresh packet of yeast. Whisk in remaining sugar, the milk, egg, and salt. Once these wet ingredients are mixed together, lightly cover and set the bowl aside as you work on the next step.",
      "Cut the cold butter into 1/4 inch slices and add to a food processor or blender. Top with 2 and 1/2 cups flour. Pulse the mixture 12-15 times, until butter is crumbled into pea-size bits. See photo below for a visual. Using a food processor or blender is best for this dough. Keeping that in mind, if you don\u2019t have one, you can use a pastry cutter to work in the butter.",
      "Pour the flour mixture into the wet yeast mixture. Very gently fold everything together using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Fold *just until* the dry ingredients are moistened. The butter must remain in pieces and crumbles, which creates a flaky pastry. Turn the sticky dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap, parchment paper, aluminum foil, or into any container you can tightly cover.",
      "1st Refrigeration: Wrap the dough/cover up tightly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 48 hours.",
      "Roll & Fold: Take the dough out of the refrigerator to begin the \u201crolling and folding\u201d process. If the dough sat for more than 4 hours, it may have slightly puffed up and that\u2019s ok. (It will deflate as you shape it, which is also ok.) Very generously flour a work surface. The dough is very sticky, so make sure you have more flour nearby as you roll and fold. Using the palm of your hands, gently flatten the dough into a small square. Using a rolling pin, roll out into a 15\u00d78 inch rectangle. When needed, flour the work surface and dough as you are rolling. Fold the dough into thirds as if it were a business letter. (See photos and video tutorial.) Turn it clockwise and roll it out into a 15 inch long rectangle again. Then, fold into thirds again. Turn it clockwise. You\u2019ll repeat rolling and folding 1 more time for a total of 3 times.",
      "2nd Refrigeration: Wrap up/seal tightly and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. You can also freeze the dough at this point. See freezing instructions.",
      "Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Rimmed baking sheets are best because butter may leak from the dough as it bakes. If you don\u2019t have rimmed baking sheets, when it\u2019s time to preheat the oven, place another baking sheet on the oven rack below to catch any butter that may drip.",
      "Make the cheese filling: In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and egg yolk together on medium speed until smooth. Add the sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla, then beat until smooth. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.",
      "Take the dough out of the refrigerator and cut it in half. Wrap 1 half up and keep refrigerated as you work with the first half. (You can freeze half of the dough at this point, use the freezing instructions below.)",
      "On a floured work surface, roll dough out into a 12\u00d78 inch rectangle. You can roll out the dough on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper or lightly floured silicone baking mat instead because you will transfer the shaped dough to a lined baking sheet next.",
      "Using a sharp knife, cut off two corners of the dough (on one 8-inch side) and then two small triangles 3 inches apart from each other on the other end (the other 8-inch side). See visual below.",
      "Spread 1/2 of the cream cheese filling down the length of the center of the strip, which should be about 3 inches wide. Dot with half of the blueberries (1/3 cup). Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut 10 slanting strips (3/4 \u2013 1 inch wide each) along both sides. Fold strips over filling, alternating each side to resemble a twist or a braid. Fold the bottom end up to seal the filling inside. Repeat with the second half of the dough and the rest of the filling. The braids may seem very narrow, but they puff up and out as they bake.",
      "Egg Wash: Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Brush all over the dough. If you want a little crunch from almonds, sprinkle them evenly on top of the braids after brushing the dough with egg wash.",
      "I strongly recommend refrigerating the shaped braids before baking for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour before baking. The braids tend to leak more butter and/or lose more shape if they haven\u2019t chilled.",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).",
      "Bake each braid for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown. Some butter may leak from the dough, that\u2019s completely normal and expected. Feel free to remove the baking sheets from the oven halfway through baking and brush the dough with any of the leaking butter, then place back in the oven to finish baking. (That\u2019s what I do!)",
      "Remove baked braids from the oven and cool for at least 5 minutes before icing, cutting, and serving.",
      "Vanilla Icing: Whisk the icing ingredients together. If you want a thicker icing, whisk in more confectioners\u2019 sugar. If you want a thinner icing, whisk in more milk or cream. Drizzle over warm pastries and serve.",
      "Cover leftover iced or un-iced pastries and store at room temperature for 1 day or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Or you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Thaw before serving. Before enjoying, feel free to reheat leftover iced or un-iced pastries in the microwave for a few seconds until warmed."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Prepare the dough as instructed in steps 2-4. At this point the dough can be refrigerated up to 48 hours. You can also prepare the dough through step 6. At this point the dough can be refrigerated up to 24 hours. During or after this second chilling time, you could also freeze the dough for up to 1 month.

You can also freeze the shaped and filled braids after shaping them in step 13. Thaw in the refrigerator, then continue with step 14.",
      "Temperature & Substitutions: The temperature of your ingredients is imperative to this pastry\u2019s success. Make sure you take the time to warm the water and bring the milk to room temperature. Keep the butter in the refrigerator until you need it in step 3. I do not recommend any substitutions in this carefully formulated dough, though a lower fat or nondairy milk works in a pinch. For the egg wash, low fat or nondairy milks work, as do heavy cream or half-and-half.",

      "for topping: 1/2 cup (64g) sliced or chopped almonds and\u00a01 extra Tablespoon oats"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Berry Filling: Whisk the cornstarch and water together until all the cornstarch has dissolved. (I just use a fork to mix\u2014very easy.) Place the cornstarch mixture, berries, maple syrup, and coconut sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Using a rubber spatula, stir the mixture as it cooks. Smash some of the berries against the bottom/sides of the pot as you stir, gently breaking them up. Bring to a simmer and allow to simmer for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. After 2 minutes, remove pan from the heat and allow to cool completely. The mixture will thicken as it cools. To speed up the cooling process, feel free to cover and refrigerate it after it slightly cools for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. I recommend making the berry filling in advance so it can cool completely. Berry filling can be cold or room temperature when you assemble the bars\u2014you just don\u2019t want it hot or warm.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch or 9-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the bars out (makes cutting easier!). Set aside.",
      "Make the crust/streusel: Pulse the oats in a food processor or blender until they\u2019re slightly broken up. (For whole oats, about 10 pulses. For quick oats, about 5-6 pulses.) Pour into a bowl and stir in the cinnamon, almond butter, maple syrup, applesauce, and melted coconut oil. Mixture will be thick and wet.",
      "Using the back of a flat spatula or a spoon, press about 3/4 of the crust/streusel mixture tightly and firmly down into the pan. Make sure it\u2019s flat and very compact, which helps guarantee the bars will hold their shape. Spread cooled berry filling evenly on top.",
      "For Topping: Mix the sliced almonds into the remaining crust/streusel mixture. Sprinkle all over the top of the berry filling. Sprinkle 1 Tablespoon of oats evenly on top. (Helps soak up some moisture.)",
      "Bake for 27-31 minutes or until the topping is lightly browned. Remove from the oven and place baking pan on a cooling rack. Allow bars to cool completely. After about 1 hour cooling at room temperature, you can place the pan in the refrigerator to help speed the cooling up. Lift the cooled bars out using the parchment paper overhang on the sides. Cut into squares.",
      "Cover and store leftover bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: Layer the cooled and cut bars between sheets of parchment in a freezer-friendly bag or container. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Glass Mixing Bowls | Medium Saucepan | Rubber Spatula | 8-inch Square Baking Pan or 9-inch Square Baking Pan | Food Processor or Blender",
      "Fruits: You need 2 cups of fresh or frozen berries. I typically use 1 cup of blueberries, 1/2 cup of chopped strawberries, and 1/2 cup of raspberries. You can use a blend of mixed berries or only blueberries, blackberries, or even chopped cherries. I haven\u2019t tested this recipe with other fruits, but let me know if you try it.",
      "Nut Butter: I recommend using creamy almond butter, but you can use crunchy instead if needed. You can also replace with peanut butter (natural or non-natural), cashew butter, or another nut butter of your choice. Sunflower seed butter is a great nut-free alternative.",
      "Ingredient Questions: I\u2019ve made these bars countless times with all sort of ingredients substitutions. See all successful ingredient substitutions in the blog post above.",
      "Topping: I mix sliced almonds into the topping, but you can use any chopped nut (or sunflower seeds/pepitas) instead. I don\u2019t recommend skipping this addition because it helps bulk up the topping. If you don\u2019t have any nuts, add 1/4 cup (20g) of whole or quick oats to the topping mixture in step 5. No need to pulse them first and no need for that extra 1 Tablespoon of oats."

    "instructions": [
      "Preliminary note: To help guarantee success, I recommend reading through the recipe, watching the video tutorial, and reading the explanations below this recipe. (All answer many FAQs.) Do not use an electric mixer for this dough. It\u2019s best if the dough is folded together with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula since it is so sticky. There is very minimal mixing required.",
      "Make the Pastry Dough: Whisk the warm water, yeast, and 1 Tablespoon (6g) of sugar together in a large bowl. Cover and allow to rest until foamy on top, about 5 minutes. If the surface doesn\u2019t have bubbles on top or look foamy after 15 minutes (it should if the yeast isn\u2019t expired), start over with a fresh packet of yeast. Whisk in remaining sugar, the milk, egg, and salt. Once these wet ingredients are mixed together, lightly cover and set the bowl aside as you work on the next step.",
      "Cut the cold butter into 1/4 inch slices and add to a food processor or blender. Top with 2 and 1/2 cups flour. Pulse the mixture 12-15 times, until butter is crumbled into pea-size bits. See photo below for a visual. Using a food processor or blender is best for this dough. Keeping that in mind, if you don\u2019t have one, you can use a pastry cutter to work in the butter.",
      "Pour the flour mixture into the wet yeast mixture. Very gently fold everything together using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Fold *just until* the dry ingredients are moistened. The butter must remain in pieces and crumbles, which creates a flaky pastry. Turn the sticky dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap, parchment paper, aluminum foil, or into any container you can tightly cover.",
      "1st Refrigeration: Wrap the dough/cover up tightly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 48 hours.",
      "Roll & Fold: Take the dough out of the refrigerator to begin the \u201crolling and folding\u201d process. If the dough sat for more than 4 hours, it may have slightly puffed up and that\u2019s ok. (It will deflate as you shape it, which is also ok.) Very generously flour a work surface. The dough is very sticky, so make sure you have more flour nearby as you roll and fold. Using the palm of your hands, gently flatten the dough into a small square. Using a rolling pin, roll out into a 15\u00d78 inch rectangle. When needed, flour the work surface and dough as you are rolling. Fold the dough into thirds as if it were a business letter. (See photos and video tutorial.) Turn it clockwise and roll it out into a 15 inch long rectangle again. Then, fold into thirds again. Turn it clockwise. You\u2019ll repeat rolling and folding 1 more time for a total of 3 times.",
      "2nd Refrigeration: Wrap up/seal tightly and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. You can also freeze the dough at this point. See freezing instructions.",
      "Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Rimmed baking sheets are best because butter may leak from the dough as it bakes. If you don\u2019t have rimmed baking sheets, when it\u2019s time to preheat the oven, place another baking sheet on the oven rack below to catch any butter that may drip.",
      "Take the dough out of the refrigerator and cut it in half. Wrap 1 half up and keep refrigerated as you work with the first half. (You can freeze half of the dough at this point, use the freezing instructions below.)",
      "Shape into rounds: Cut the first half of dough into 8 even pieces. This will be about 1/4 cup of dough per pastry. Roll each into balls. Flatten each into a 2.5 inch circle. Use your fingers to create a lip around the edges. See photos and video tutorial if needed. Press the center down to flatten the center as much as you can so you can fit the filling inside. (Center puffs up as it bakes.) Arrange pastries 3 inches apart on a lined baking sheet. Repeat with second half of dough.",
      "Spoon 2 teaspoons of fruity filling or 1 Tablespoon of cheese filling inside each.",
      "Egg Wash: Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Brush on the edges of each shaped pastry.",
      "This step is optional, but I very strongly recommend it. Chill the shaped pastries in the refrigerator, covered or uncovered, for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour. See recipe note. You can preheat the oven as they finish up chilling.",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).",
      "Bake for 19-22 minutes or until golden brown around the edges. Some butter may leak from the dough, that\u2019s completely normal and expected. Feel free to remove the baking sheets from the oven halfway through baking and brush the dough with any of the leaking butter, then place back in the oven to finish baking. (That\u2019s what I do!)",
      "Remove baked pastries from the oven. Cool for at least 5 minutes before icing/serving.",
      "Make the icing: Whisk the icing ingredients together. If you want a thicker icing, whisk in more confectioners\u2019 sugar. If you want a thinner icing, whisk in more milk or cream. Drizzle over warm pastries and serve.",
      "Cover leftover iced or un-iced pastries and store at room temperature for 1 day or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Or you can freeze them for up to 3 months. Thaw before serving. Before enjoying, feel free to reheat leftover iced or un-iced pastries in the microwave for a few seconds until warmed."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Prepare the dough as instructed in steps 2-4. At this point the dough can be refrigerated up to 48 hours. You can also prepare the dough through step 6. At this point the dough can be refrigerated up to 24 hours. During or after this second chilling time, you could also freeze the dough for up to 1 month. (I don\u2019t recommend freezing the dough before the rolling and folding step.) Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then continue with step 8. You can also freeze the unfilled pastries after shaping them in step 10. Thaw in the refrigerator, then continue with step 11.",

      "Fruity Fillings: You need around 2/3 cup (about 200g) of filling for the entire recipe (16 pastries). Use jam or fruit preserves, pumpkin butter, apple butter, lemon curd, cherry pie filling, etc. Or even Nutella! You need 2 heaping teaspoons per pastry. Feel free to mix and match, making different flavors in your batch.",
      "Cheese Filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed, beat one 8 ounce block (224g) of full-fat cream cheese that is softened at room temperature in a medium bowl until smooth. Beat in 1 large egg yolk, 1/3 cup\u00a0(67g)\u00a0granulated sugar, 1/2 teaspoon\u00a0fresh\u00a0lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon\u00a0pure vanilla extract until smooth. Use 1 scant Tablespoon per pastry. Feel free to dot the cream cheese filling with fresh berries before baking or mix fruit preserves in with the cream cheese filling (still using 2-3 teaspoons of filling per pastry).",
      "Temperature & Substitutions: The temperature of your ingredients is imperative to this pastry\u2019s success. Make sure you take the time to warm the water and bring the milk to room temperature. Keep the butter in the refrigerator until you need it in step 3. I do not recommend any substitutions in this carefully formulated dough, though a lower fat or nondairy milk works in a pinch. For the egg wash and icing, low fat or nondairy milks work, as do heavy cream or half-and-half.",
      "Yeast: Platinum Yeast from Red Star is an instant yeast. If needed, you can use active dry yeast instead. The instructions and amount remain exactly the same regardless of which you use.",
      "Optional Step (step 13): Chilling the shaped pastries in the refrigerator helps them maintain their shape in the oven. Remember, cold pastry dough is best. I usually refrigerate them for 15 minutes as the oven preheats. If you\u2019re nervous to chill the baking sheets in the refrigerator then bake them (which can cause warping), you have two other options. You can simply assemble the pastries on parchment paper or silicone baking mats, lift the parchment/baking mat as a whole and place on another baking sheet or directly onto a shelf in the refrigerator. After chilling, carefully lift up and place the entire parchment/baking mat onto the baking sheets for baking. Or you can use a thin spatula and very carefully transfer the assembled unbaked pastries to a large plate to chill.",
      "Halve the Recipe? I don\u2019t recommend halving this dough recipe. Make the dough as written, then freeze half after step 9. Or make 8 breakfast pastries and 1 pastry braid (cream cheese or raspberry).",

      "Why the initial high oven temperature?\u00a0Like I do for most\u00a0muffin recipes, bake the muffins for 5 minutes at a very hot temperature. Then, keeping the muffins in the oven, switch to a lower temperature for the remaining bake time. This initial high temperature will quickly lift the muffin tops so they\u2019re extra high, then the centers will bake during the lower temperature bake time. This trick makes beautiful bakery-style muffins every time."

    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm milk, yeast, and sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes. The mixture should be a little frothy on top after 5 minutes. If not, start over with new yeast.",
      "Add the eggs, butter, vanilla, nutmeg, salt, and 2 cups (245g) flour. Beat on low speed for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add remaining flour and beat on medium speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. If needed, add more flour, 1 Tablespoon at a time, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Don\u2019t add too much flour, though. You want a slightly sticky dough. *If you do not own a mixer, you can mix this dough with a large wooden spoon or rubber spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle!*",
      "Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 2 minutes or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 2 minutes.",
      "Let Dough Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1.5-2 hours or until double in size. (For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise?\u00a0in my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Shape Doughnuts: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. Remove dough from the bowl and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. If needed, punch down again to release any more air bubbles. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out until it is 1/2 inch thick. Using a 3-3.5 inch doughnut cutter, cut into 12 doughnuts. If you can\u2019t quite get 12, re-roll the scraps and cut more. (*If you don\u2019t have a doughnut cutter, you can use 1 large + 1 smaller circle cookie cutter. Large should be about 3 and 1/2 inches.)",
      "Line 1 or 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Place doughnuts and doughnut holes on each. (Feel free to discard doughnut holes if you don\u2019t want to make them.) Loosely cover and allow to rest as you heat the oil. They will rise a bit as they rest. Place a cooling rack over another baking sheet.",
      "Pour oil into a large heavy-duty pot set over medium heat. Heat oil to 375\u00b0F (191\u00b0C). Add 2-3 doughnuts at a time and cook for 1 minute on each side. Carefully remove with a metal spatula or metal slotted spoon. Wear kitchen gloves if oil is splashing. Place fried doughnuts onto prepared cooling rack. Repeat with remaining doughnuts, then turn off heat.* (See note for doughnut holes.)",
      "Make the icing:\u00a0In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the butter and maple syrup together, whisking occasionally. Once the butter has melted, remove from heat and whisk in the sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar, salt, and maple extract. Dip each warm doughnut into the icing. The icing quickly thickens, so feel free to place it back over heat as you dip the doughnuts. Place dipped doughnuts back onto cooling rack as excess icing drips down. Gently press bacon slices on top of each. (You can also crumble/chop up the bacon for topping.) After about 30 minutes, the glaze will set + harden.",
      "Doughnuts are best enjoyed the same day. You can store in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for 1-2 extra days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: Prepare recipe through step 5. Freeze shaped doughnuts for up to 3 months. On the day you serve them, let the doughnuts thaw and rest at room temperature for about 4-5 hours. Fry as directed. You can also freeze the fried doughnuts (unglazed). Allow them to cool completely, then freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature, then reheat as desired (microwave is great) and top with icing and bacon.",
      "Overnight Instructions: Complete dough through step 3. Instead of allowing to rise in a warm environment in step 4, place the covered dough into the refrigerator overnight (8-12 hours). The next morning, remove from the refrigerator and allow to rise in a warm environment until doubled. The dough will lightly rise in the refrigerator overnight, so the rise the next morning won\u2019t be too long. After rising, continue with step 5.",

      "Doughnut Holes: Add holes to hot oil and fry until golden, about 30 seconds, on each side.",
      "Milk: Whole milk is a must for the most tender dough\u2014or you can try buttermilk. Lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch, but the doughnuts aren\u2019t as flavorful or rich.",
      "Yeast: If using an instant yeast, your rise time will be a little shorter. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Oil: The amount of oil really depends on how wide or tall your pot is. You want oil to fill about 1/3 of the pot. I use a little more than 1 quart for my 4 and 1/2 quart Dutch oven.",
      "Leftover Oil: Do not pour used oil down the sink drain. Allow to cool, then pour into an empty container and discard in the trash or reuse it.",

    "instructions": [
      "Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast together. Set aside. Heat the milk and butter together in the microwave until the butter is melted and the mixture is warm to the touch, between 100-110\u00b0F, 38-43\u00b0C. Pour the warm milk mixture into the dry ingredients. Add the egg. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment, or using a rubber spatula and mixing by hand, beat/mix the mixture until a soft dough forms. The dough is ready when it gently pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If the dough is pretty sticky, beat/mix in 2-4 extra Tablespoons of flour. (Keep in mind that you want the dough to remain on the softer side.)",
      "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 3 minutes (for a visual, watch me knead in the video above). If you\u2019d rather use the mixer to knead it, beat the dough on low speed for 3 minutes instead. After kneading, poke the dough with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, the dough is ready for the next step. If not, keep kneading.",
      "Form the dough into a ball on your work surface. Cover it with a clean towel, aluminum foil, or plastic wrap, then let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Alternatively, the ball of dough can rest in a covered and lightly greased mixing bowl.",
      "Make the filling:\u00a0After 30 minutes, use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a 15\u00d712 inch rectangle. Evenly spread the softened butter on top. Mix the sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkle it all over the buttered dough.",
      "Grease a 9-inch round pie dish or 9-inch round cake pan with butter or nonstick spray.",
      "Shape the cinnamon roll cake: See the video tutorial and my step-by-step photos above for a visual of this shaping step. Using a very sharp knife or a pizza cutter, cut the dough into six 2-inch wide strips. Roll up one strip and place it in the center of the pan. Coil the remaining 5 strips around the center roll, starting each strip at the end of the previous one to make one large cinnamon roll. Some of the filling may spill out as you pick up the strips, so just sprinkle it on top of the cake when you\u2019re done shaping it.",
      "Loosely cover the cake with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and allow it to rise in a relatively warm, draft-free environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size. (Tip: Rising at room temperature is usually fine, but on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C). Turn the oven off, place the shaped cake inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it\u2019s doubled in size, remove from the oven.)",
      "Bake: After the cake\u2019s dough has doubled in size, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. If you notice the top or edges browning too quickly, tent the cake with aluminum foil. While the giant cinnamon roll cake is baking, some spots may rise up more than other spots. That\u2019s completely normal and expected from something this large. Simply remove the pan from the oven and, with the back of a spatula, press down the spots that are rising taller than others to help keep them even. Return to baking.",
      "Remove the finished cinnamon roll cake from the oven and cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the icing.",

See video and photo above for a closer look at the texture. Place in the refrigerator or freezer as you mix the wet ingredients together.",
      "Whisk 1/2 cup buttermilk, the egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Drizzle over the flour mixture, then mix together until everything appears moistened.",
      "To make triangle scones: Pour onto the counter and, with floured hands, work dough into a ball as best you can. Dough will be sticky. If it\u2019s too sticky, add a little more flour. If it seems too dry, add 1 more Tablespoon buttermilk. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut into 8 wedges. For smaller scones, press dough into two 5-inch discs and cut each into 8 wedges. To make 10-12 drop scones: Keep mixing dough in the bowl until it comes together. Drop scones, about 1/4 cup of dough each, 3 inches apart on a lined baking sheet.",
      "Brush scones with remaining buttermilk and for extra crunch, sprinkle with coarse sugar. (You can do this before or after refrigerating in the next step.)",
      "Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet (if your fridge has space!) and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).",
      "Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat(s). If making mini or drop scones, use 2 baking sheets. After refrigerating, arrange scones 2-3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet(s).",
      "Bake for 18-26 minutes or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on top. Larger scones take closer to 25 minutes. (Tip: I like to start the icing while the scones cook so the milk has a chance to steep.) Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes before icing.",
      "Make the icing: In a small saucepan over low heat, bring the milk to a simmer. Remove from heat and immediately add the lavender. Set aside to steep for 15 minutes. Strain the milk through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl, then discard the lavender. Cool for 5 minutes. Whisk in the lemon juice and confectioners\u2019 sugar. Feel free to add more confectioners\u2019 sugar to thicken, if desired. Drizzle over warm scones. Icing can be made 1-2 days ahead and stored in the refrigerator.",
      "Leftover scones keep well at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for 5 days."

      "Freeze Before Baking:\u00a0Freeze scone dough wedges on a plate or baking sheet for 1 hour. Once relatively frozen, you can layer them in a freezer-friendly bag or container. Bake from frozen, adding a few minutes to the bake time. Or thaw overnight, then bake as directed.",
      "Freeze After Baking:\u00a0Freeze the baked and cooled scones before topping with icing. I usually freeze in a freezer-friendly bag or container. To thaw, leave out on the counter for a few hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm in the microwave for 30 seconds or on a baking sheet in a 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) oven for 10 minutes.",
      "Overnight Instructions:\u00a0Prepare scones through step 4. Cover and refrigerate shaped scones overnight. Continue with the recipe the following day.",
      "Over-spreading: Start with very cold scone dough. Expect some spread, but if the scones are over-spreading as they bake, remove from the oven and press back into its triangle shape (or whatever shape) using a rubber spatula.",
      "Lemon: 1 medium lemon is plenty for the zest and juice you need for this recipe (zest for the dough and juice for the icing).",
      "Buttermilk: You can substitute heavy cream for buttermilk if desired. Acidic buttermilk isn\u2019t needed in order for the scones to rise since we\u2019re using baking powder. However if you\u2019d like the tangy flavor you can make your own sour milk substitute. Add 1 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice or white vinegar to a liquid measuring cup. Add enough milk to make 1/2 cup. Whisk together, then let sit for 5 minutes before using in the recipe. For the extra 2 Tablespoons needed for brushing on top of the scones, you can use regular milk or heavy cream. Whole milk is best for the DIY sour milk substitute, though lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch. (The scones will spread more if using lower fat or nondairy milks.)"

Press crumbs tightly on top of the batter to help prevent them from falling off as the muffins rise. Bake at 425\u00b0F for 5 minutes, then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) and continue to bake for 15-17 for regular size muffins (20-22 minutes total) or another 22-23 minutes for jumbo size muffins (27-28 minutes total).

In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined and creamy, about 1-2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat until combined. Add the dry ingredients and begin beating on low speed. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the buttermilk. Finally, add the chocolate chips. Beat on low until everything is combined. Avoid over-mixing. Using a large spoon or silicone spatula, gently fold in the raspberries. They\u2019ll break a little bit, but try to be extra careful.",

Anything that holds 8-10 cups of batter works. The bake time slightly changes, so keep your eye on the cake after about 42 minutes and have a toothpick handy to check for doneness. For a 9\u00d75-inch loaf pan, bake for at least 60-65 minutes. For muffins, follow the same baking instructions as my blueberry streusel muffins. For a larger 9\u00d713-inch cake, double the recipe.

However if you\u2019d like the tangy flavor, you can make your own sour milk substitute. Add 2 teaspoons of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1 cup. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe."

It will take a bit of arm muscle!*",

      "1st Rise:\u00a0Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size.

Working one at a time, take small pieces of dough and roll into balls (about 1.25 inches in diameter each). You will need 40-45 balls total, so be modest with their size. Dip each ball, one by one, in the melted butter and then generously roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat them. You may need more cinnamon-sugar depending how heavy you coat each ball. Arrange the balls in the Bundt pan as you go. Cover the pan with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel and allow the shaped monkey bread to rest for 20 minutes. The balls will slightly rise during this time.",

Fold the dough over the blueberries, then seal the edges. Using your hands, work the dough into an even log, making sure the edges are totally sealed. Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut the dough into about 12 even strips, then cut 4-5 perpendicular strips to make a cross pattern of sorts. This is NOT an exact process, so don\u2019t stress. You really just need a bunch of small pieces of blueberry-filled dough! Divide the cut-up dough into 12 even pieces. Mold each into a round shape and try to \u201cenclose\u201d the blueberries inside the dough as much as you can. (They\u2019ll fall out of the fritters otherwise.)

Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is completely smooth. To make a lovely edge, I do not trim excess dough around the edges. Instead, fold the excess dough back over the edge and use your hands to mold the edge into a rim around the pie. Crimp the edges with a fork or use your fingers to flute the edges.

Prick holes all around the bottom crust with a fork. Return the pie crust to the oven. Bake until the bottom crust is just beginning to brown, about 7-8 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.

      "1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter. Takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.)",

Shape each piece into a smooth ball, pinching it on the bottom to seal. I do this entirely in my hands and you can watch in the video above. Arrange in prepared baking pan.",

Spoon paste into a piping bag or zipped-top bag. (No need to use a piping tip if using a piping bag.) Snip off a small piece at the corner. Pipe a line down the center of each row of buns, then repeat in the other direction to create crosses.",
      "Bake the rolls: Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown on top, rotating the pan halfway through. If you notice the tops browning too quickly, loosely tent the pan with aluminum foil. Remove from the oven and allow rolls to cool for a few minutes as you prepare the icing.",

      "Freezing Instructions: Prepare recipe through step 6. Place shaped buns in a greased baking pan, cover tightly, and freeze for up to 3 months. Once frozen, the dough balls won\u2019t stick together anymore and you can place them in a freezer bag if needed. On the day you serve them, arrange the dough balls in a greased baking pan, cover tightly, then let them thaw and rise at room temperature for about 4-5 hours. Continue with step 8. You can also freeze the baked hot cross buns. Allow them to cool completely, then freeze without icing for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature, then reheat as desired and add icing.",
      "Overnight Instructions: Prepare the recipe through step 6. Cover the shaped buns tightly and refrigerate for up to about 15 hours. At least 3 hours before you need them the next day, remove the buns from the refrigerator, keep covered, and allow to rise on the counter for about 1-2 hours before baking. (Skip step 7.) Alternatively, you can let the dough have its 1st rise in the refrigerator overnight. Cover the dough tightly and place in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours. Remove from the refrigerator and allow the dough to fully rise for 2 more hours. Continue with step 5.",

      "Optional Add-Ins: Instead of (or in addition to) raisins, try using dried cranberries, chopped pecans or walnuts, chopped candied citrus, or chopped dried apricots. Keep total add ins to about 1 and 3/4 cups total. Feel free to add the zest from 1 lemon or orange to the dough when you add the butter. Add 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves or cardamom, if desired. Feel free to adjust the spices to your liking. You can plump up the raisins, currants, or dried cranberries if desired. Soak in hot water for 5-10 minutes, drain, then pat dry before adding to dough.",
      "Whole Milk: Lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch. The rolls will lose a little flavor and richness. I highly recommend whole milk or even buttermilk.",
      "Cinnamon: Cinnamon can prohibit doughs from rising. We use 1 and 1/4 teaspoons in this dough to produce dense buns. If you want a fluffier roll-type hot cross bun, feel free to reduce the cinnamon down to 1/2 teaspoon or leave it out completely.",
      "Yeast: Use instant yeast or active dry yeast. Rise times will be slightly longer using active dry yeast. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Flour: You can use all-purpose flour or bread flour. All-purpose flour is convenient for most, but bread flour produces chewier hot cross buns. Either flour is fine and there are no other changes to the recipe if you use one or the other.",
      "Icing Cross: If you prefer to make a cross from icing and pipe it onto the buns after baking, skip step 9 and skip the orange icing glaze on top. However, you can use the orange icing recipe to make the icing cross. Reduce orange juice to 1 Tablespoon to yield a very thick icing. Replace with milk and add a splash of vanilla extract, if desired. Feel free to also make the orange glaze for topping if you want double icing\u2014a cross and glaze all over."

      "Prepare the dough:\u00a0Whisk the warm water and yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes.",
      "Add the flour, brown sugar, and salt. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. The dough is very stiff and will look somewhat dry.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 6-7 minutes. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading. The dough is too heavy for the mixer to knead it.",
      "Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel.\u00a0 Allow the dough to rise at room temperature\u00a0for 60-90 minutes or until double in size.",
      "Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.",
      "Shape the bagels: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces. (Just eyeball it\u2013 doesn\u2019t need to be perfect!) Shape each piece into a ball. Press your index finger through the center of each ball to make a hole about 1.5 \u2013 2 inches in diameter. Watch video below for a visual. Loosely cover the shaped bagels with kitchen towel and rest for a few minutes as you prepare the water bath.",
      "Preheat oven to\u00a0425\u00b0F (218\u00b0C).",
      "Water bath:\u00a0Fill a large, wide pot with 2 quarts of water. Whisk in\u00a0the honey. Bring water to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high. Drop\u00a0bagels in, 2-4 at a time, making sure they have enough room to float around. Cook the bagels\u00a0for 1\u00a0minute on each side.",

      "Bake for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. You want the bagels to be a dark golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow bagels to cool on the baking sheets for 20 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",

    ],
    "notes": [
      "Overnight Make Ahead Instructions: Prepare the dough through step 4, but allow the dough to rise overnight in the refrigerator instead of at room temperature for 60-90 minutes. The slow rise gives the bagels wonderful flavor! In the morning, remove the dough from the refrigerator and let the dough rise for 45 minutes at room temperature. Continue with step 5. I don\u2019t recommend shaping the bagels the night before as they may puff up too much overnight.",
      "Freezing Make Ahead Instructions:\u00a0Baked bagels freeze wonderfully! Freeze them for up to 3 months, thaw overnight in the refrigerator or at room temperature, then warm to your liking. You can also freeze the bagel dough. After punching down the dough in step 6, wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap, then a layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then punch the dough down again to release any air bubbles. Continue with the rest of step 6.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Stand Mixer | Baking Sheets | Parchment Paper or Silicone Baking Mats | Large Pot (such as a large 5.5 quart dutch oven) | Pastry Brush",
      "Yeast: Use instant or active dry yeast. If using active dry yeast, the rise time may be up to 2 hours. 1 standard packet is about 2 and 1/4 teaspoons, so you will need a little more than 1 packet of yeast. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Bread Flour:\u00a0Bagels require a high protein flour. Bread flour is a must. Here are all my recipes using bread flour if you want more recipes to use it up. All-purpose flour can be used in a pinch, but the bagels will taste flimsy and won\u2019t be nearly as chewy.",
      "Barley Malt Syrup:\u00a0This ingredient can be a little hard to find, but truly gives bagels that traditional malty flavor we all know and love. Most natural food stores carry it. I offer alternatives such as brown sugar in the dough and honey in the water bath; I\u2019ve made bagels with these alternatives AND with barley malt syrup and honestly love both versions.",
      "Bread Machine:\u00a0Place the dough ingredients into the pan of the machine. Program the machine to dough or manual, then start. After 9-10 minutes, the dough will be quite stiff. Allow the machine to complete its cycle, then continue with the recipe.",
      "Bagel Varieties: See blog post above for various add-ins and toppings. Note that the toppings are added after the egg wash in step 9. Some readers have used this bagel recipe to make whole wheat bagels by replacing half of the bread flour with whole wheat flour. I haven\u2019t tried it, but let me know if you do!",
      "Halve or Double: You can halve this dough recipe by simply halving all of the dough ingredients (do not halve the water or honey for the boiling step). No changes to the recipe instructions. For best taste and texture and to not overwhelm your mixer with excess heavy dough, I do not recommend doubling this dough recipe. Instead, make separate batches of dough.",

      "Meat:\u00a0If it\u2019s not pre-cooked, cook and crumble the sausage in a medium skillet before using. You can also use the same amount of cooked crumbled bacon or diced cooked ham.",
      "Cheese:\u00a0Use your favorite. Feta cheese, shredded pepper jack, smoked gouda, or cheddar cheese would be great!",
      "Butter for the biscuits: 6 Tablespoons go into the biscuit dough and the other 2 Tablespoons will be brushed on top before baking. Make sure 6 Tablespoons of butter (for the dough) is cold and cubed and 2 Tablespoons (for the topping) is melted.",
      "Canned biscuits:\u00a0Though I recommend homemade (yum!), you can use canned biscuits. Follow this recipe as written, subbing canned biscuits for homemade. If prepping the casserole in advance, place sliced canned biscuits on top of casserole immediately before baking. Don\u2019t let them sit on the un-baked casserole for too long.",
      "Added flavor:\u00a0Depending on the cheese and meat you use, there\u2019s plenty of flavor in the breakfast casserole. If desired for added flavor, add a sprinkle of garlic powder, dry mustard, or smoked paprika to the egg/milk mixture."

Using lightly floured hands, form it into a ball. If the dough is too sticky to handle, add 1-3 more Tablespoons of flour, but you want a very soft dough.",

Divide into 4 equal pieces and, with a floured rolling pin, roll each out into a thin 10-inch circle. Place the bottom circle on prepared baking sheet. If it lost its circle shape, use your hands to form the edges back into a round shape. Top with filling, then layer the remaining circles and filling on top.\u00a0The top layer does not have filling on it, so only 3 of the 4 circles will be topped with filling. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut any scraps around the edges so you have an even circle. Place a 3 inch round object or bowl in the center and make an indent. This is the center of the star. Now it\u2019s time to cut strips from the edge to the center 3-inch circle. Using a pizza cutter, cut 16 even strips. Using both hands, grab two strips and twist them away from each other twice, then press the two ends together to make a point. Your star bread will have 8 points.",

      "Pumpkin Pie Spice: You can use store-bought or homemade pumpkin pie spice here. If you don\u2019t have either and want to use individual spices, use 1/2 teaspoon each: ground allspice and ground ginger AND 1/4 teaspoon each: ground nutmeg and ground cloves. This is in addition to the 1 teaspoon of cinnamon in the recipe\u2014you will still add that.",
      "Blotting Pumpkin: Using a paper towel or clean kitchen towel, lightly blot the pumpkin puree to remove some of the moisture before using in the recipe. The more moisture removed, the less moist and muffin-like the scones will taste. We want the scones to be flaky and crumbly, not super moist or muffin-like. I prefer to squeeze lots of moisture out so the scones taste textured and delicious. Do what you prefer!"

Heat the milk on the stove or in the microwave until warm to touch, about 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C). Pour warm milk on top of yeast/sugar. Whisk gently to combine, then loosely cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to sit for 5-10 minutes. The mixture will be frothy after 5-10 minutes.",
      "If you do not have a mixer, you can mix by hand in this step.\u00a0Add the butter, egg, flour, and salt. Beat on low speed for 3 minutes. Dough will be soft. Transfer it to a lightly floured work surface. Using lightly floured hands, knead it for 1 minute. If the dough is too sticky to handle, add 1-3 more Tablespoons of flour, but you want a very soft dough. Shape into a ball.",
      "Place the dough in a greased bowl (I use nonstick spray to grease) and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place in a slightly warm environment to rise until doubled in size, around 60-90 minutes.\u00a0(If desired, use my warm oven trick for rising. See my answer to\u00a0Where Should Dough Rise?\u00a0in my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide.)",

      "Make the cream cheese filling:\u00a0In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat all of the filling ingredients together until combined. Cover tightly and set aside until ready to use. (Don\u2019t refrigerate unless making well in advance. It\u2019s easiest to spread on the dough when at room temperature. If refrigerated, let it come to room temperature before spreading on dough in step 7.)",
      "Make the topping: Combine the poppy seeds, sesame seeds, dried minced onion, dried garlic flakes, and coarse salt together in a small bowl. Set aside.",
      "Assemble the bread:\u00a0Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and with a floured rolling pin, roll out until the dough is about 1/4 inch thick. The dough can be any shape, just as long as it\u2019s around 1/4 inch thick. Spread cream cheese filling on top. Using a\u00a03.5 \u2013 4 inch circle cookie cutter, cut into circles. I get about 12 circles. Fold circles in half and line in prepared baking pan, round side up. See photos above for a visual.",
      "Cover\u00a0with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rise once again in a slightly warm environment until puffy, about 45 minutes.",

Make sure you load it onto each! Then just save the leftover scraps to make pizza, rolls, whatever. But I found it easier to spread the whole thing with the garlic herb mozzarella cream cheese mixture. See below for what I do with my extra dough scraps!"

      "Preliminary notes: I have lots of information to prepare you to make homemade chocolate croissants. A complete guide to making the croissant dough, with a video and step-by-step photographs, can be found in my original croissants recipe. That post will help you get through the first several steps. Additionally, you can see the post above for a visual for how the chocolate croissants are shaped, which begins in step 13 below. Make room in the refrigerator for a baking sheet. In step 6 and again in step 13, you will need room for 2 baking sheets.",
      "Make the dough: Cut the butter in four 1-Tablespoon slices and place in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). Add the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine the ingredients for 1 minute. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the milk. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium speed and beat the dough for at least 5 full minutes. (If you don\u2019t have a mixer, knead by hand for 5 minutes.) The dough will be soft. It will (mostly) pull away from the sides of the bowl and if you poke it with your finger, it will bounce back. If after 5 minutes the dough is too sticky, keep the mixer running until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.",
      "Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured silicone baking mat lined, lightly floured parchment paper lined, or lightly floured baking sheet. (I recommend a silicone baking mat because you can roll the dough out in the next step directly on top and it won\u2019t slide all over the counter.) Gently flatten the dough out, and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.",
      "Shape the dough: Remove the dough from the refrigerator. I like to keep the dough on the silicone baking mat when I\u2019m rolling it in this step because the mat is nonstick and it\u2019s a handy guide for the exact measurement. Begin flattening out the dough with your hands. You\u2019re rolling it out into a rectangle in this step, so shaping it with your hands first helps the stretchy dough. Roll it into a 14\u00d710-inch rectangle. The dough isn\u2019t extremely cold after only 30 minutes in the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with the measurement. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle.",
      "Long rest: Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet (this is why I prefer a silicone baking mat or parchment because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)",
      "Butter layer (begin this 35 minutes before the next step so the butter can chill for 30 minutes): In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and flour together until smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. (Silicone baking mat is preferred because you can easily peel the butter off in the next step.) Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7\u00d710-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. (No need to cover it for only 30 minutes.) You want the butter layer firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step.",
      "Laminate the dough:\u00a0In this next step, you will be rolling out the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn\u2019t an exact 7\u00d710-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10\u00d720-inch rectangle. It\u2019s best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing you. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. Again, the dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn.",
      "If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn.\u00a0I usually don\u2019t have to.",
      "2nd turn:\u00a0Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10\u00d720-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between the 2nd\u00a0and 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn.",
      "3rd turn: Roll the dough out once again into a 10\u00d720-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter.",
      "Long rest: Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.\u00a0(Up to 24 hours is ok.)",
      "At the end of the next step, you\u2019ll need 2 baking sheets lined with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. The dough is currently on a lined baking sheet in the refrigerator, so you already have 1 prepared!",
      "Shape the croissants: Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an 8\u00d720-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each skinny rectangle will be 4 inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4\u00d75-inch rectangles. See photo above for a visual. Cut each rectangle in half lengthwise so you have 16 2\u00d75-inch rectangles. Work with one rectangle at a time. Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch it to be about 8 inches long. Do this gently as you do not want to flatten the layers. Place a few small pieces of chocolate in a single layer at one end and tightly roll the dough up around the chocolate. Make sure the end is on the bottom. Repeat with remaining dough, placing the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rest at room temperature (no warmer! I suggest just keeping on the counter) for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours. (Or freeze, see freezing instructions. I prefer the shaped croissants to be cold going into the oven.",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).",
      "Egg wash:\u00a0Whisk the egg wash ingredients together.\u00a0Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with egg wash.",
      "Bake the croissants:\u00a0Bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).",
      "Remove chocolate croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as they cool. If desired, dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar before serving.",
      "Croissants taste best the same day they\u2019re baked. Cover any leftover croissants and store at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze for up to 3 months, then thaw on the counter or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm up to your liking."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: Croissants are perfect for getting started ahead of time. The dough can rest for 4 hours or overnight in step 5 and again in step 11. You can also freeze the dough after the 3rd turn in the lamination process (after step 10). Instead of the 4 hour rest in the refrigerator in step 11, wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place in a freezer zipped-top bag, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator and continue with step 12. You can also freeze the shaped croissants after they rest for 1 hour at room temperature in step 13. (Before placing in the refrigerator.)

      "Yeast: I use and recommend Red Star Platinum, an instant yeast. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Chocolate: You can find 4 ounce chocolate baking bars in the baking aisle. I recommend using Ghirardelli brand because the bars are thin and the thin pieces roll up neatly in the croissant dough. I use bittersweet chocolate, but you can use milk chocolate, semi-sweet, or darker chocolate.",
      "Keep Dough Cold: Make sure the dough is ALWAYS cold. If it warms up too much, stop what you\u2019re doing and place the dough back in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.",
      "Floured Surface: Lightly flour the work surface, your hands, the dough, and the rolling pin as you work.",

Roll it into a 14\u00d710-inch rectangle. The dough isn\u2019t extremely cold after only 30 minutes in the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with the measurement. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle.",
      "Long rest: Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet (this is why I prefer a silicone baking mat or parchment because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.\u00a0(Up to 24 hours is ok.)",
      "Butter layer (begin this 35 minutes before the next step so the butter can chill for 30 minutes): In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and flour together until smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. (Silicone baking mat is preferred because you can easily peel the butter off in the next step.) Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7\u00d710-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. (No need to cover it for only 30 minutes.) You want the butter layer firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step.",
      "Laminate the dough:\u00a0In this next step, you will be rolling out the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn\u2019t an exact 7\u00d710-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10\u00d720-inch rectangle. It\u2019s best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing you, like I do in the video below. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. Again, the dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn.",
      "If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn.\u00a0I usually don\u2019t have to.",
      "2nd turn:\u00a0Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10\u00d720-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between the 2nd\u00a0and 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn.",
      "3rd turn: Roll the dough out once again into a 10\u00d720-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter.",
      "\u00a0Long rest: Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.\u00a0(Up to 24 hours is ok.)",
      "At the end of the next step, you\u2019ll need 2 baking sheets lined with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. The dough is currently on a lined baking sheet in the refrigerator, so you already have 1 prepared!",
      "Shape the croissants: Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an 8\u00d720-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each skinny rectangle will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4\u00d75-inch rectangles. See photo above for a visual. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. You have 16 triangles now. Work with one triangle at a time. Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8 inches long. Do this gently as you do not want to flatten the layers. Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up into a crescent shape making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend the ends in towards each other. Repeat with remaining dough, placing the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rest at room temperature (no warmer\u2013 I suggest keeping on the counter) for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours. (Or freeze, see freezing instructions.) I prefer the shaped croissants to be cold going into the oven.",

    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm milk, 2 Tablespoons sugar, and the yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/rubber spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula is a better choice.*",
      "On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won\u2019t really be mixing into the mixture, so don\u2019t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it\u2019s fully incorporated before adding the next. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft.",
      "Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if you used the paddle) and beat on low speed for an additional 5 minutes OR knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes. If kneading by hand, keep a small bowl of flour nearby to continually flour your hands, as the dough can be quite sticky. After kneading, poke the dough with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.\u00a0",
      "1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Grease the bottom and sides of a metal or glass 9\u00d713-inch baking dish or line with parchment paper.",
      "Roll out the dough: Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 12\u00d718-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you\u2019re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier.",
      "Fill the rolls: Spread the softened butter all over the dough. In a small bowl, toss the brown sugar and cinnamon together until combined and then sprinkle evenly over the dough. Top evenly with chopped apples. Tightly roll up the dough to form an 18-inch-long log. Cut into 12 equal rolls. Arrange them in the prepared baking pan. Cover the rolls very tightly with aluminum foil.",
      "2nd rise: Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until puffy, about 45-60 minutes.(Or use the overnight option in the Notes below).",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (191\u00b0C).",
      "Bake for about 25 minutes or until they lightly browned on top. About halfway through baking time, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes as you make the icing.",
      "Make the icing: Whisk all of the icing ingredients together and drizzle over warm rolls. Serve warm.",
      "Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Overnight: To prepare the night before serving, prepare the rolls through step 7. Cover the rolls tightly and refrigerate for 8\u201312 hours. (16 hours max. 8\u201312 hours is best, but 16 hours is OK if absolutely needed. Do not exceed 16 hours.) The next morning, remove from the refrigerator and allow to rise on the counter for 1\u20132 hours before continuing with step 9.",
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Freezing: Baked rolls can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and warm up before enjoying. You can also freeze the unbaked rolls and here\u2019s how: bake the rolls in step 9 for only about 10 minutes. Cool completely, then cover tightly and freeze.

      "Milk: I recommend using whole milk for the best, richest-tasting dough. You could also use buttermilk. Reduced-fat, low-fat, or nondairy milk works in a pinch. Do not use nonfat milk.",
      "Yeast: I always use Platinum Yeast from Red Star, an instant yeast. You can use an active dry yeast instead, if needed. The rise times could be slightly longer. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide for answers to common yeast FAQs."

    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm milk, 2 Tablespoons sugar, and the yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/rubber spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula is a better choice.*",
      "On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won\u2019t really be mixing into the mixture, so don\u2019t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it\u2019s fully incorporated before adding the next. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft.",
      "Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if you used the paddle) and beat on low speed for an additional 3 minutes OR knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes. If kneading by hand, keep a small bowl of flour nearby to continually flour your hands, as the dough can be quite sticky. After kneading, poke the dough with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.\u00a0",
      "1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise?\u00a0in my\u00a0Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Meanwhile, make the topping: Grease the bottom and sides of a 9\u00d713-inch glass baking dish or metal baking dish. Spread chopped pecans in an even layer in the pan. Set aside. Combine the rest of the topping ingredients in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the butter has melted, then bring to a simmer. Allow to simmer for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, give it a quick whisk, then pour over pecans. Set aside.",
      "Roll out the dough: Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 12\u00d718-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you\u2019re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier.",
      "For the filling: Spread the softened butter all over the dough. The softer the butter is, the easier it is to spread in this step. (Microwave it for a few seconds to soften if needed.) In a small bowl, mix the sugar and cinnamon together. Sprinkle evenly over the butter. Tightly roll up the dough to form an 18-inch-long log. If some filling spills out, sprinkle it on top of the roll. With an extra sharp knife, cut into 12 even rolls, about 1.5 inches each. Arrange in the prepared baking pan, on top of the pecan topping.",
      "2nd Rise: Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until puffy, about 90 minutes. (Or use the overnight option in the Notes below.)",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).\u00a0Bake for about 25\u201328 minutes or until they are lightly browned on top. About halfway through the bake time, loosely tent a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly.  Remove pan from the oven and place on a wire rack. Cool for 5 minutes.",
      "Using oven mitts, carefully invert the pan onto a large serving platter. The warm topping will melt down the sides. Serve warm."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Overnight: To prepare the night before serving, prepare the rolls through step 7. Cover the rolls tightly and refrigerate for 8\u201312 hours. (16 hours max. 8\u201312 hours is best, but 16 hours is OK if absolutely needed. Do not exceed 16 hours.) The next morning, remove from the refrigerator and allow to rise on the counter for 1\u20132 hours before continuing with step 9.",
      "Make Ahead Instructions \u2013 Freezing: Baked rolls can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and warm up before enjoying. You can also freeze the unbaked rolls and here\u2019s how: bake the rolls in step 9 for only about 10 minutes. Cool completely, then cover tightly and freeze. To serve, take the rolls out of the freezer and place in the refrigerator overnight to thaw. Once thawed, finish baking them for about 15\u201320 minutes.",

      "Milk: Whole milk or 2% is best for this rich dough and topping. Update to the recipe in 2021: I reduced the amount of milk in the topping from 3/4 cup to 1/4 cup to help avoid any separation issues. The topping stays together much better now with only 1/4 cup (60ml) of milk.",
      "Yeast: If using active dry yeast, the rise times will be slightly longer. I always use an instant yeast. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide for answers to common yeast FAQs.",
      "Brown Sugar: Dark brown sugar is wonderful for extra flavor, but light brown sugar works too."

However, the decrease in rise is so slight that it doesn\u2019t make a noticeable difference. That being said, you can shape this scone dough into wedges and refrigerate overnight before baking. You can also freeze before baking. Freeze scone dough wedges on a plate or baking sheet for 1 hour. Once relatively frozen, you can layer them in a freezer-friendly bag or container. Bake from frozen, adding a few minutes to the bake time in the recipe below. Or thaw overnight, then bake as directed. You can also freeze the baked and cooled scones before topping with icing. To thaw, leave out on the counter for a few hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm in the microwave for 30 seconds or on a baking sheet in a 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) oven for 10 minutes.",

      "1 and 1/2 tablespoons Platinum Yeast from Red Star instant yeast\u00a0(2 standard size packets)",

      "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "2 Tablespoons (30ml) milk"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Make the dough: Heat milk to about 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C) using a microwave or stovetop. Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand electric mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (OR you can use a handheld mixer OR no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). With a whisk, manually whisk in the sugar and yeast. Cover with a towel and let sit until the yeast is foamy, about 5-10 minutes. If the yeast does not dissolve and foam, start over with fresh active yeast. On low speed, beat in the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Next add the eggs, one at a time, and then the salt. The butter won\u2019t really be mixing into the mixture, so don\u2019t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. On low speed, gradually add the flour. Once it is all added, beat on medium speed until a soft dough forms. Increase speed to medium-high and beat until the dough is soft and supple, about 6 minutes longer. *If you do not have a stand-mixer with a hook attachment, knead the dough by hand in this step.",
      "Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it with your hands for 1 minute. Form the dough into a ball and transfer it to a lightly greased bowl. Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap, a paper towel, or aluminum foil and let sit in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 to 2 hours.\u00a0Here\u2019s what I do:\u00a0turn the oven on to\u00a0200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C). Once heated to that temperature, turn the oven off. Stick the covered dough inside the oven and allow it to rise in this warm environment.",
      "Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Lightly flour the parchment paper. Place the dough on top and, with floured hands, pat down to roughly form a 10\u00d720-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick.",
      "For the filling:\u00a0Spread the softened butter all over the dough. In a small bowl, toss the cinnamon and sugar together until combined and then sprinkle evenly over the dough. Tightly roll up the dough to form a 20-inch long log. Cut into 20 1-inch rolls, only slicing 3/4 of the way through so they are still connected at the bottom. Use kitchen shears if you need to.",
      "Shape the wreath: Turn one of the end cinnamon rolls on its side. Turn the next one so that it slightly overlaps the first. Repeat with each roll, forming into a circle and overlapping each. Again,\u00a0kitchen shears help to cut any dough as you\u2019re shaping.",
      "Place a ramekin in the middle of the wreath. This will help it hold its shape.",
      "Cover the wreath loosely with plastic wrap and slide a baking sheet underneath the whole thing. Use a large one with no edges\u00a0so it can slide under easily.\u00a0Allow to rise again in a warm environment until puffy, about 45 minutes \u2013 1 hour.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Bake for about 25 minutes, until the rolls are golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10\u00a0minutes before topping with icing.",
      "Make the icing: Whisk all of the icing ingredients together in a medium bowl. Drizzle over wreath."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Overnight Instructions: Prepare the rolls through step 6. Instead of allowing to rise in a warm environment in step 7, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the wreath to rest for up to 14 hours before baking. When it\u2019s time to bake the next day, allow the rolls to come to room temperature and rise for 1 hour on the counter, or until almost doubled in size. Then bake as directed.",
      "Freezing Instructions: Let the wreath\u00a0cool completely on the parchment paper that you baked it on and transfer to a large Tupperware (along with the parchment). Then cover with a layer of aluminum foil and freeze. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator. Transfer to a baking sheet and heat in a 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) oven until warmed throughout, about 20 minutes. Drizzle with icing and serve.",

If you don\u2019t have either and want to use individual spices, use 1/4 teaspoon each of ground ginger, ground nutmeg, ground cloves, and ground allspice in the muffin batter. Do not leave out the 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon that is also in the muffin batter. The crumb topping also uses pumpkin pie spice and, again, if you don\u2019t have store-bought or homemade, use 1/4 teaspoon of each of those spices and add 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon too.",

    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm buttermilk, 2 Tablespoons sugar, and the yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/rubber spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula is a better choice.*",
      "On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won\u2019t really be mixing into the mixture, so don\u2019t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it\u2019s fully incorporated before adding the next. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft.",
      "Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if you used the paddle) and beat on low speed for an additional 5 minutes OR knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes. If kneading by hand, keep a small bowl of flour nearby to continually flour your hands, as the dough can be quite sticky. After kneading, poke the dough with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.\u00a0",
      "1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Grease the bottom and sides of a metal or glass 9\u00d713-inch baking dish or line with parchment paper.\u00a0",
      "Roll out the dough: Punch down the dough to release the air. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and, using a rolling pin, roll into a 10\u00d716-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you\u2019re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier.",
      "For the filling: Spread the softened butter all over the dough. In a small bowl, toss the cinnamon and sugar together until combined and then sprinkle evenly over the dough. Tightly roll up the dough to form a 16 inch long log. If some filling spills out, that\u2019s ok just sprinkle it on top of the rolls. Cut into 8 large rolls (about 2 inches in width each). Arrange them in the prepared baking pan.\u00a0",
      "2nd Rise: Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until puffy, about 2 hours. (Or use the overnight option in the Notes below.)",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (191\u00b0C).",
      "Bake for about 25 minutes or until they are lightly browned on top. About halfway through baking time, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly. Remove pan from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes as you make the icing.",
      "Make the icing: In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth and creamy. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, cream/milk, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 1 minute. Spread the icing over the warm rolls and serve immediately.",

      "Almond Meal: You can use store-bought almond meal or almond flour, or you can make your own. Start with 1/3 cup of slivered, sliced, or whole almonds. Pulse them in a food processor until a crumbly meal has formed. Do not run the food processor continuously; you may end up with almond butter. Little pulses are best. You will end up with around 1/3 cup almond meal.",
      "Peanuts: I like to use salted peanuts because they make the bars salty/sweet. If using unsalted, add 1/8 teaspoon of salt to the recipe.",
      "Mini Chocolate Chips: I like to use mini chocolate chips because you get more in each bite! Regular size chocolate chips work as well."

      "Buttermilk: You can substitute heavy cream for buttermilk if desired. Acidic buttermilk isn\u2019t needed in order for the scones to rise since we\u2019re using baking powder. However if you\u2019d like the tangy flavor you can make your own sour milk substitute. Add 1 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice or white vinegar to a liquid measuring cup. Add enough milk to make 1/2 cup. Whisk together, then let sit for 5 minutes before using in the recipe. For the extra 2 Tablespoons needed for brushing on top of the scones, you can use regular milk or heavy cream. Whole milk is best for the DIY sour milk substitute, though lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch. (The scones will spread more if using lower fat or nondairy milks.)"

Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook or paddle attachment (OR you can use a handheld mixer). Whisk in the yeast and 1 teaspoon granulated sugar. Cover with a clean towel and let sit until the yeast is foamy, about 5-10 minutes. This is called proofing the yeast. If the yeast does not dissolve and foam, start over with fresh active yeast. On low speed, beat in\u00a0the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, salt, butter, egg, and 2 cups of flour until combined. The dough will be wet. While continuing to beat on low speed, add the remaining flour 1/4 cup at a time until a soft dough forms.\u00a0Dough will be ready when it gently pulls away from the sides of the bowl. I usually use 2 and 3/4 cups flour total. **If you do not have a mixer, you can stir the dough by hand with a wooden spoon in this step.",

During this 10 minutes, line a 4 or 5 quart slow cooker with greased parchment paper. (I spray it with non-stick spray, but brushing oil or softened butter all over it works too.) If you have a larger slow cooker, that\u2019s ok\u2013 just space the rolls out more.",
      "Make the filling:\u00a0After 10 minutes, roll the dough out in a 14\u00d78 inch rectangle. Spread the softened butter on top. Mix the cinnamon and sugar together, then sprinkle on top of the butter. Roll the dough up tightly, then cut into 10-12 even pieces and place them inside the lined slow cooker.\u00a0Place a paper towel right under the lid of the slow cooker\u2013 this will help keep condensation off of the cooking rolls. Do not leave that step out and do not use a cloth towel.",
      "Turn your slow cooker on high speed and cook for 2 hours, or until the rolls are fully cooked through. It\u2019s usually 2 hours, sometimes\u00a02 hours and 15 minutes. Once they\u2019re done, remove the rolls from the cooker right away by lifting out the parchment paper.",
      "Make the icing:\u00a0Right before serving, top\u00a0your cinnamon rolls with glaze. Whisk the confectioners\u2019\u00a0sugar, maple syrup, and milk together until smooth. Add a little more milk if too thick. Drizzle over the warm rolls.",
      "Rolls are best enjoyed the same day, but stay fresh covered tightly in the refrigerator for 5 days. Rolls (with or without icing) freeze well up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and heat up however you prefer."

    "description": "These cranberry orange scones are buttery and moist with crisp crumbly edges and soft flaky centers. Crunchy coarse sugar and an orange glaze are the perfect finishing touches! Read through the recipe before beginning. You can skip the chilling for 15 minutes prior to baking, but I highly recommend it to prevent the scones from over-spreading.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), plus more for hands and work surface",
      "1/2 cup (100g)\u00a0granulated sugar",
      "2 and 1/2 teaspoons\u00a0baking powder",
      "1/2 teaspoon salt",
      "2 teaspoons orange zest (about 1 orange)",
      "1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, frozen",
      "1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream",
      "1 large egg",

      "2\u20133 Tablespoons (30-45ml) fresh orange juice*"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and orange zest together in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter using a box grater. Add it to the flour mixture and combine with a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes together in pea-sized crumbs. See video above for a closer look at the texture. Place in the refrigerator or freezer as you mix the wet ingredients together.",
      "Whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Drizzle over the flour mixture, add the cranberries, then mix together until everything appears moistened.",
      "Pour onto the counter and, with floured hands, work dough into a ball as best you can. Dough will be sticky. If it\u2019s too sticky, add a little more flour. If it seems too dry, add 1-2 more Tablespoons heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut into 8 wedges.",
      "Brush scones with remaining heavy cream and for extra crunch, sprinkle with coarse sugar. (You can do this before or after refrigerating in the next step.)",
      "Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet (if your fridge has space!) and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).",
      "Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. After refrigerating, arrange scones 2-3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet(s).",
      "Bake for 22-25 minutes or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on top. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for a few minutes as you make the glaze.",
      "Make the glaze: Whisk the confectioners\u2019 sugar and orange juice together. Add a little more confectioners\u2019 sugar to thicken or more juice to thin. Drizzle over scones.",
      "Leftover iced or un-glazed scones keep well at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freeze Before Baking: Freeze scone dough wedges on a plate or baking sheet for 1 hour. Once relatively frozen, you can layer them in a freezer-friendly bag or container. Bake from frozen, adding a few minutes to the bake time. Or thaw overnight, then bake as directed.",
      "Freeze After Baking: Freeze the baked and cooled scones before topping with icing. I usually freeze in a freezer-friendly bag or container. To thaw, leave out on the counter for a few hours or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm in the microwave for 30 seconds or on a baking sheet in a 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) oven for 10 minutes.",
      "Overnight Instructions: Prepare scones through step 4. Cover and refrigerate overnight. Continue with the recipe the following day.",

      "Over-spreading: Start with very cold scone dough. Expect some spread, but if the scones are over-spreading as they bake, remove from the oven and press back into its triangle shape (or whatever shape) using a silicone spatula.",
      "Cranberries: I prefer to use frozen cranberries because they keep the scone dough super cold. Fresh or even dried works too. Same amount.",
      "Orange Juice: I prefer fresh orange juice. You\u2019ll have an orange anyway\u2014the one you zested for the scone dough! Store-bought orange juice works too, of course."

      "Transfer mixture to prepared baking pan and press very firmly into an even layer. You really want it packed in tight- as tight as possible. Bake for 20-22 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack for 1 hour, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill for 1 more hour. This helps firm up the bars which makes\u00a0them stay compact. Remove\u00a0bars from the pan using the overhang on the sides\u00a0and cut into bars.\u00a0Individually wrap each bar in plastic wrap or parchment. Store at room temperature for 1 week or in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. I find they get a little sticky at room temperature over a few days, so I prefer the refrigerator."

      "Almond Meal: You can use store-bought almond meal or almond flour, or you can make your own. Start with 1/4 cup of slivered, sliced, or whole almonds. Pulse them in a food processor until a crumbly meal has formed. Do not run the food processor continuously; you may end up with almond butter. Little pulses are best. You will end up with around 1/4 cup almond meal.",
      "Pumpkin Pie Spice: You can use store-bought or homemade pumpkin pie spice. Instead of prepared pumpkin pie spice, you can use 1/4 teaspoon each of ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, ground ginger, and 1/8 teaspoon each ground cloves and ground allspice.",
      "Pepitas: I like to use salted pepitas because they add a little salt to the sweet dried cranberries/honey. I love the salty sweet taste! If using unsalted, add another 1/8 teaspoon salt to the recipe OR use salted almonds."

      "1 and 3/4 cups (220g) whole wheat flour*\u00a0(spooned & leveled)",
      "1 teaspoon baking powder",

      "1/2 cup (95g) lightly packed brown sugar",
      "1 cup (228g) pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)",
      "5 Tablespoons (71g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled*",
      "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "1/3 cup (80ml) milk (I use almond milk; any milk is OK)",
      "1/2 cup (90g) mini chocolate chips*"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease/spray two mini muffin pans with nonstick cooking spray. This recipe makes around 36\u00a0muffins, so you will only use half of the 2nd pan. If using mini liners, grease/spray them with cooking spray. Set pans aside.",
      "In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, brown sugar, pumpkin puree, melted butter, vanilla, and milk together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, stir a few times, then add the mini chocolate chips. Fold everything together gently just until combined.",
      "Fill muffin cups around 3/4 \u2013 all the way full. Go for about 1 heaping Tablespoon of batter per muffin. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If your oven has hot spots, be sure to rotate the pans during bake time. My muffins took 12 minutes. Remove pans from the oven. Allow muffins to slightly cool before enjoying."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Muffins stay fresh in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for 5-7 days. Muffins can be frozen up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and warm to your liking before serving.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): 24-count Mini Muffin Pan | Glass Mixing Bowls | Whisk | Silicone Spatula",
      "Flour: You can also use white whole wheat flour or all-purpose flour. Or a mix of whole wheat and all-purpose.",
      "Pumpkin Pie Spice:\u00a0You can find pumpkin pie spice in the baking aisle of most grocery stores or make your own homemade pumpkin pie spice. If you don\u2019t have either and want to use individual spices, use 1/4 teaspoon each: ground ginger, ground nutmeg, ground cloves, and ground allspice. This is in addition to the 1 teaspoon of cinnamon\u2014you will still add that.",
      "Butter: I do not recommend leaving out the butter. This is what makes these muffins tender and similar to the texture of higher calorie pumpkin muffins. You can use oil or melted coconut oil in its place. Do not sub applesauce; the muffins will have a rubbery texture.",
      "Chocolate Chips: Mini chocolate chips are best. You get many more in each muffin which makes them taste so good. Feel free to increase mini chocolate chips to 2/3 cup (I\u2019ve done that\u2014so good!). I do not recommend regular size.",
      "Regular Size Muffins: Makes 12-14 regular size muffins. Bake for 5 minutes at\u00a0425\u00b0F (218\u00b0C), then keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce temperature to\u00a0350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) and bake for\u00a0an additional\u00a016 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total times these muffins take in the oven is about 20-21 minutes, give or take. The initial high temperature helps create tall muffin tops. You\u2019ll love it!"

      "1 Tablespoon ground cinnamon"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm milk, 2 Tablespoons sugar, and the yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow mixture to sit for about 5 minutes or until foamy on top. *If you do not own a mixer, you can do this in a large mixing bowl and in the next step, mix the dough together with a large wooden spoon/rubber spatula. It will take a bit of arm muscle. A hand mixer works, but the sticky dough repeatedly gets stuck in the beaters. Mixing by hand with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula is a better choice.*",
      "On medium speed, beat in the remaining sugar (which should be 1/2 cup/100g) and the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs and salt and beat on medium speed until combined. The butter won\u2019t really be mixing into the mixture, so don\u2019t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. Switch the mixer down to low speed and with it running, add 1 cup of flour at a time, making sure it\u2019s fully incorporated before adding the next. After 4 cups have been added, add the last 1/2 cup and beat until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 3 minutes. Dough will be soft.",
      "Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if you used the paddle) and beat on low speed for an additional 3 minutes or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes OR knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes. If kneading by hand, keep a small bowl of flour nearby to continually flour your hands, as the dough can be quite sticky. After kneading, poke the dough with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.\u00a0",
      "1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or use nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise in a relatively warm environment for 2 hours or until double in size. (I always let it rise on the counter and it takes about 2 hours. For a tiny reduction in rise time, see my answer to Where Should Dough Rise? in my Baking with Yeast Guide.)",
      "Grease the bottom and sides of a 9\u00d713 baking dish or line with parchment paper.\u00a0",
      "Roll out the dough: Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 12\u00d718-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick. If the dough keeps shrinking as you roll it out, stop what you\u2019re doing, cover it lightly, and let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten. When you return to the dough, it should stretch out much easier.",
      "For the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and maple syrup together on medium-high speed until combined and creamy. Add the sugar and cinnamon, beating until combined. Spread the maple mixture all over the dough. Tightly roll up the dough to form an 18-inch-long log. Cut into 12 even rolls, about 1.5 inches each. Arrange in the prepared baking pan.",
      "2nd Rise: Cover the rolls tightly and allow to rise until puffy, about 90 minutes. (Or use the overnight option in the Notes below.)",
      "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (191\u00b0C).\u00a0",
      "Bake for about 25 minutes, until they are lightly browned on top. About halfway through the bake time, tent a piece of aluminum foil over the pan to prevent the tops from browning too quickly. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a wire rack for about 10 minutes as you make the icing.",
      "Make the icing: Whisk all of the icing ingredients together. If it\u2019s too thin, add a little more confectioners\u2019 sugar. Drizzle icing over warm rolls.\u00a0",
      "Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\u00a0"

If it seems too dry, add 1-2 more Tablespoons heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut into 8 wedges.",

      "Freeze Before Baking: Freeze scone dough wedges on a plate or baking sheet for 1 hour. Once relatively frozen, you can layer them in a freezer-friendly bag or container. Bake from frozen, adding a few minutes to the bake time. Or thaw overnight, then bake as directed.",
      "Freeze After Baking: Freeze the baked and cooled scones before topping with icing. I usually freeze in a freezer-friendly bag or container.

Pour the warm milk into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (OR you can use a handheld mixer). With a spoon, manually stir in the sugar and yeast. Cover the bowl with a towel and let sit until the yeast is foamy, about 5-10 minutes. If the yeast does not dissolve and foam, start over with fresh yeast. On low speed, beat in the softened butter until it is slightly broken up. Add the eggs, one at a time, and then the salt. The butter won\u2019t really be mixing into the mixture, so don\u2019t be alarmed if it stays in pieces. On low speed, gradually add the flour. Once it is all added, beat on medium speed until a soft dough forms\u2014about 4 minutes.",

Cover the dough loosely with plastic wrap, a paper towel, or aluminum foil and let sit in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Here\u2019s what I do: turn the oven on to 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C). Turn the oven off. Stick the covered dough inside the oven and allow it to rise in this warm environment.",
      "As the dough rises, make the filling:\u00a0Warm the strawberries in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir constantly for 4 minutes until the strawberries begin to release juices. Add the granulated sugar and cornstarch and continue to stir for another 2 minutes. The mixture will thicken. Remove from the heat, spoon into a heatproof bowl or container, and chill until ready to use. You do not want a warm filling as you spread it onto the dough.",

      "Cover the rolls and allow to rise in a warm environment once again until the are puffy\u2014about 1 \u2013 2 hours (or overnight, see Overnight instructions.)",
      "After the rolls have risen, preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C). Bake for about 25 minutes, until they are golden brown. About halfway through the bake time, I like to cover the rolls loosely with aluminum foil so the tops don\u2019t brown too much. Remove pan from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes as you make the glaze.",

If using unsalted, add another 1/8 teaspoon salt to the recipe. Instead of sunflower seeds, try using chopped peanuts, cashews, or almonds.",

Top with more paper towels and press down hard so the paper towels can absorb a lot of the moisture. You want a lot\u00a0of the moisture gone, so just keep squeezing and using new paper towels as\u00a0necessary. Alternatively, you can\u00a0shred the potatoes onto a kitchen towel, wrap them up, and squeeze them out over the sink.",

Cook the bacon on both sides just before they become crispy. They will go back onto the stove and then in the oven, so they have more time to cook later in this recipe. Remove from heat, reserve the grease, and set bacon on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb some grease. Once the bacon is slightly cool, you can chop it up.",

Allow to cook for about 2 minutes, untouched. Add the chopped pepper, salt, and pepper. Stir things around once or twice, then flatten everything out using the back of a wooden spoon or spatula. Allow to cook, untouched for 3 minutes. Stir, then allow to cook for 2 more minutes. The potatoes should be getting quite brown at this point. If not, continue to cook a little longer while stirring occasionally until they are. Stir in the chopped bacon and cook for 2 minutes. Remove skillet from the heat and flatten out the top of the hash using the back of a wooden spoon or spatula. Then, using the back of a spoon, make 4 shallow indentations into the hash. Crack an egg into each indentation. Top with shredded cheese (I usually sprinkle it around the eggs).",

      "Chocolate: Use baking chocolate sold as 4 ounce bars in the baking aisle, such as Ghirardelli or Baker\u2019s brand.\u00a0 1 heaping cup semi-sweet chocolate chips may be substituted for the chopped chocolate in the scones. Chocolate chips are a little tricky to melt into a pourable consistency, so I recommend sticking with the chocolate bar for the drizzle on top. The drizzle is optional."

Then, keeping the muffins in the oven, switch to a lower temperature for the remaining bake time. This initial high temperature will quickly lift the muffin tops so they\u2019re extra high, then the centers will bake during the lower temperature bake time. This trick makes beautiful bakery-style muffins every time."

They taste one million times better and are made completely from scratch with REAL ingredients. I encourage you to read this entire recipe before beginning, as well as viewing the step-by-step photos to help guide you. Plan ahead, the pastry must chill for some time.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 and 1/2 cups (313g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)",
      "1 teaspoon salt",
      "6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, chilled and cubed",
      "2/3 cup\u00a0(130g)\u00a0vegetable shortening, chilled",
      "1/2\u00a0cup (120ml) ice water",

      "1/2 teaspoon\u00a0ground cinnamon",
      "1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "For the pastry: This is the same recipe as my homemade pie crust. See step-by-step photos in the pie crust post if you need visuals for making the pastry. I usually make the pastry the night before. First, mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add cold unsalted butter and shortening. Using a pastry cutter or two forks, cut the butter and shortening until the mixture resembles coarse meal (pea-sized crumbles with a few larger bits of fat is OK). Measure 1/2 cup of water in a glass. Add ice. Stir it around. Slowly drizzle in the very cold water 1 Tablespoon at a time, stirring with a large spatula after every Tablespoon of water that you add. Do not add any more water than you need to. Stop adding water when the dough begins to clump.",
      "Roll out the dough on a floured work surface. The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly sticky.\u00a0Form the dough into a ball.\u00a0Divide in half. Flatten each half into 1-inch thick discs using your hands. Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2\u00a0hours (or up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months).",
      "Assemble the pop-tarts: Remove 1 chilled dough disc from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. This will help make the dough easier to roll and work with. Keep the other disc in the refrigerator. After 15 minutes, place disc onto a lightly floured work surface, and roll it into a rectangle about 1/8 inch thick and 9\u00d712-inches in size. Trim the sides as needed. Always be gentle with your pastry dough. You don\u2019t want it to tear. Cut each piece of dough into thirds and each third into thirds again. You will end up with 9 rectangles, each measuring 3\u00d74 inches. Use a ruler to help make this process easier and more accurate.",
      "Place each of the 9 rectangles onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. The pop-tarts will not spread in the oven much, so you may place them relatively near one another. Place the baking sheet\u00a0in the fridge. Roll 2nd disc out into a rectangle and cut into 9 even\u00a0rectangles like you did with the first half of the\u00a0dough. These nine rectangles will be the tops of your homemade pop-tarts. Place the baking sheet into the refrigerator as you make the brown sugar cinnamon filling.",
      "Make the filling: Mix the brown sugar, cinnamon, and flour together in a small bowl. Set aside. Remove 1 baking sheet of rectangles from the refrigerator. Brush egg wash over the entire surface of each rectangle. These will be the bottoms of your pop-tarts and the egg wash will help glue the lid on. Place a heaping Tablespoon of the prepared brown sugar filling into the center of each rectangle, spread it around, leaving around 1/4 inch of space on the edges. Brush the second baking sheet of rectangles with egg wash, then place each rectangle on top of the filling-topped rectangles, egg wash side down. Use your fingertips to press firmly around the pocket of filling, sealing the dough well on all sides.",
      "Poke holes in the tops of each filled pastry to allow the steam to escape. This helps get your pop-tart pastry nice and flaky. I used a toothpick to poke 8 holes in each. Seal the edges by crimping with a fork, to prevent the sides from opening as the pop-tarts bake. Refrigerate the filled pop-tarts\u00a0uncovered for at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour. This chilling let the pop-tarts rest before baking. It also\u00a0firms up the\u00a0pastry, since it has been out at room temperature for so long at this point.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Once unbaked pop-tarts have chilled for 20 minutes, remove from the refrigerator and brush the tops with the remaining egg wash. This egg wash will give your pastry that beautiful golden sheen. Bake for about 22-28 minutes or until they\u2019re golden brown, rotating the pan halfway through baking. Let the baked pop-tarts cool on the pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before glazing.",
      "Make the glaze: Whisk all of the glaze\u00a0ingredients together in a medium bowl until it reaches a spreading consistency. You want a thick glaze, but not too thick that it is hard to spread. Add another teaspoon or two of milk if needed. Use a spoon or knife to glaze each pop-tart. The glaze will slightly harden in about an hour, if you prefer to wait that long.",
      "Store pop-tarts in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 days or in the refrigerator for 6 days. To reheat, bake in a 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) oven for 10 minutes."

      "Pastry: I\u2019m sure store-bought pastry would be fine, but this homemade version creates that unique flaky, slightly crunchy yet tender texture you know and love from regular pop-tarts. I prefer shortening in my pie crust and pastry dough recipe for the best texture. Feel free to use your own favorite pie crust recipe that uses all butter if you prefer. Butter can not be replaced for shortening in this particular pastry recipe.",
      "Filling: Get creative! Use your favorite fillings instead of brown sugar cinnamon. Like jam, Nutella, etc.",

    "description": "This cheesy spinach quiche uses my favorite quiche recipe as the base. It\u2019s savory, creamy, and baked in a deliciously flaky homemade pie crust. Impress all your guests with this brunch recipe!",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 unbaked flaky pie crust (what I use) or all-butter pie crust*",
      "10 ounces (283g) frozen spinach*",
      "2 teaspoons olive oil",
      "8 ounces (227g) fresh mushrooms, sliced",
      "1 teaspoon minced garlic",
      "4 large eggs",
      "1 cup (240ml) whole milk*",
      "1/3 cup (25g) grated parmesan cheese",
      "1 cup (4 ounces/90g) shredded cheese\u00a0(I used cheddar + mozzarella)*",
      "1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper*"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Prepare pie crust: I like to make sure my pie dough is prepared before I begin the quiche. Make pie dough the night before because it needs to chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before rolling out and par-baking.",
      "Roll out the chilled pie dough: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the discs of chilled dough (save the second pie crust for another recipe). Turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle 12 inches (30cm) in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch (23cm) pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is completely smooth. To make a lovely edge, I do not trim excess dough around the edges. Instead, fold the excess dough back over the edge and use your hands to mold the edge into a rim around the pie. Crimp the edges with a fork or use your fingers to flute the edges. Chill the pie crust in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 5 days. Cover the pie crust with plastic wrap if chilling for longer than 30 minutes.",
      "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).",
      "Par-bake: Line the chilled pie crust with parchment paper. Fill with 2 packs of pie weights, or use dried beans. Make sure the weights are evenly distributed around the pie dish. Bake until the edges of the crust are starting to brown, about 15\u201316 minutes. Remove from the oven and carefully lift the parchment paper (with the weights) out of the pie. Prick holes all over the bottom crust with a fork. Return the pie crust to the oven. Bake until the bottom crust is just beginning to brown, about 7\u20138 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. (Crust can still be warm when you pour in the filling, or you can par-bake the crust up to 3 days ahead of time. Cover cooled par-baked crust tightly and refrigerate until ready to fill.)",
      "Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).",
      "For the filling: If your frozen spinach is not already thawed, thaw it in the microwave per package directions. Drain the spinach in a colander while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.",
      "In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the sliced mushrooms, garlic, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper to hot skillet (just a sprinkle of each, you\u2019ll use 1/4 teaspoon each in the next step). Stir and saut\u00e9 the mushrooms until they release all of their moisture and no more water remains on the bottom of the skillet, about 6\u20137 minutes.",
      "Whisk the eggs, milk, parmesan cheese, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper together until combined.",
      "Blot and squeeze the rest of the water out of the thawed spinach. Spread spinach on par-baked pie crust. Add the cooked mushrooms and shredded cheese. Pour the egg mixture on top. If desired, sprinkle the top with a little more parmesan cheese.",
      "Bake the quiche\u00a0until the center is just about set, about 50\u201360 minutes. Don\u2019t over-bake. Use a pie crust shield to prevent the pie crust edges from over-browning. Cool for 15 minutes before slicing and serving. Or you can cool the quiche completely before serving\u2014it\u2019s fantastic at room temperature, too.",
      "This quiche makes great leftovers! Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead\u00a0&\u00a0Freezing Instructions: The pie dough can be prepared ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months. You can par-bake the crust ahead of time too. See end of step 4. To freeze the quiche, cool baked quiche completely, then cover tightly with a layer of plastic wrap followed by a layer of aluminum foil, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight or on the counter, then bake uncovered at 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) for 20\u201325 minutes.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): 9-Inch Pie Dish | Pie Weights | Pie Crust Shield | Glass Mixing Bowl | Whisk",
      "Pie Crust: Both linked pie crust recipes make two crusts. You only need one crust for this pie, so freeze the second half for another use, or double the filling to make two quiches.",
      "Spinach: You can use fresh spinach instead, about 3 packed cups (about 120g). You can cook it down ahead of time, or just add it fresh/raw. I use cooked-down fresh spinach in this goat cheese spinach & sun-dried tomato quiche.",
      "Milk: Whole milk is best for the creamiest texture, but 1/2 cup (120ml) each heavy cream and whole milk is fantastic, too, for an even richer filling. You could also substitute 1 cup (240ml) half-and-half. See How to Bake the Perfect Quiche post.",
      "Cheese: Use 1 cup (90g) total of shredded cheese. You can mix your favorite kinds, e.g., 1/2 cup cheddar cheese + 1/2 cup feta cheese; 1/3 cup goat cheese + 2/3 cup mozzarella; 1/2 cup Swiss cheese + 1/2 cup cheddar."

Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut 10 slanting strips (3/4 \u2013 1 inch wide each) along both sides. Fold strips over filling, alternating each side to resemble a twist or a braid. Fold the bottom end up to seal the filling inside.

See photo below for a visual. Using a food processor or blender is best for this dough. Keeping that in mind, if you don\u2019t have one, you can use a pastry cutter to work in the butter.",
      "Pour the flour mixture into the wet yeast mixture. Very gently fold everything together using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Fold *just until* the dry ingredients are moistened. The butter must remain in pieces and crumbles, which creates a flaky pastry. Turn the sticky dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap, parchment paper, aluminum foil, or into any container you can tightly cover.",
      "1st Refrigeration: Wrap the dough/cover up tightly and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 48 hours.",
      "Roll & Fold: Take the dough out of the refrigerator to begin the \u201crolling and folding\u201d process. If the dough sat for more than 4 hours, it may have slightly puffed up and that\u2019s ok. (It will deflate as you shape it, which is also ok.) Very generously flour a work surface. The dough is very sticky, so make sure you have more flour nearby as you roll and fold. Using the palm of your hands, gently flatten the dough into a small square. Using a rolling pin, roll out into a 15\u00d78-inch rectangle. When needed, flour the work surface and dough as you are rolling. Fold the dough into thirds as if it were a business letter. (See photos and video tutorial.) Turn it clockwise and roll it out into a 15 inch long rectangle again. Then, fold into thirds again. Turn it clockwise. You\u2019ll repeat rolling and folding 1 more time for a total of 3 times.",
      "2nd Refrigeration: Wrap up/seal tightly and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. You can also freeze the dough at this point. See freezing instructions.",
      "Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Rimmed baking sheets are best because butter may leak from the dough as it bakes. If you don\u2019t have rimmed baking sheets, when it\u2019s time to preheat the oven, place another baking sheet on the oven rack below to catch any butter that may drip.",
      "Take the dough out of the refrigerator and cut it in half. Wrap 1 half up and keep refrigerated as you work with the first half. (You can freeze half of the dough at this point, use the freezing instructions below.)",
      "On a floured work surface, roll dough out into a 12\u00d78-inch rectangle. You can roll out the dough on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper or lightly floured silicone baking mat instead because you will transfer the shaped dough to a lined baking sheet next.",
      "Using a sharp knife, cut off two corners of the dough (on one 8-inch side) and then two small triangles 3 inches apart from each other on the other end (the other 8-inch side). See visual below.",
      "Spread 1/2 of the filling (from raspberry danish bread\u00a0or\u00a0blueberry cream cheese danish bread) down the length of the center of the strip, which should be about 3 inches wide. Using a sharp knife, pastry wheel, or pizza cutter, cut 10 slanting strips (3/4 \u2013 1 inch wide each) along both sides. Fold strips over filling, alternating each side to resemble a twist or a braid. Fold the bottom end up to seal the filling inside. Repeat with the second half of the dough and the rest of the filling. The braids may seem very narrow, but they puff up and out as they bake.",
      "Egg Wash: Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Brush all over the dough.",
      "I strongly recommend refrigerating the shaped braids before baking for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour before baking. The braids tend to leak more butter and/or lose more shape if they haven\u2019t chilled.",
      "Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C).",
      "Bake each braid for 18-22 minutes or until golden brown. Some butter may leak from the dough, that\u2019s completely normal and expected. Feel free to remove the baking sheets from the oven halfway through baking and brush the dough with any of the leaking butter, then place back in the oven to finish baking. (That\u2019s what I do!)",

      "Make the dough: In a large mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir it around a bit and let it sit for about 2 minutes. Add the milk, melted butter, sugar, eggs, salt, and 3 cups of flour. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. By hand, stir in enough remaining flour to form a firm dough. About 5 cups total.",
      "Turn the dough onto a floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-7 minutes. Do not over-knead, which will lend tough and chewy bread. The dough is ready when it is smooth and when you can poke it with a finger and it springs back. Form dough into a smooth ball and place into a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. I greased the bowl with cooking spray. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.",
      "Make the caramel sauce: The caramel sauce can\u00a0be made ahead of time (up to 1 week) and heated in the microwave for 30 seconds before using. To make the caramel, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Once melted, add brown sugar and heavy cream. Stir constantly over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Allow to bubble for 3-4 full minutes, no more. Set aside.",
      "Make the cinnamon-sugar topping: In a shallow bowl, combine cinnamon and sugar. In a separate small bowl, melt the butter. Set aside. Spray a 10-12 cup Bundt pan with cooking spray. Set aside. Punch the cold dough down very gently to allow the air bubbles to release. Pull apart pieces and roll into balls, about 1.25 inches in diameter. You will need 40-45 balls total, so be modest with their size. Dip each ball, one by one, in the melted butter and then generously roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat them well. You may need more cinnamon-sugar depending how heavy you coat each ball.",
      "Arrange 20 dough balls into the Bundt pan. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the pecans. Top with remaining dough balls and pecans. *If you did not use Red Star Platinum yeast, cover the pan and allow dough balls to rise again for about 45 minutes at room temperature. If you did use Red Star Platinum yeast, move ahead to the next step and bake right away.",
      "Preheat oven to 350F. When you are ready to bake, warm the caramel sauce up for about 30 seconds. Stir, and top the dough balls with 1/2 of the caramel sauce. Reserve the rest to pour on top after it is baked.",
      "Bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown on top. Cover loosely with foil if the top browns too quickly.",
      "Cool for 5-10 minutes, then invert onto a large serving plate. Warm up the caramel sauce again and drizzle over the bread before serving. You\u00a0can\u00a0either cut the bread into generous slices or let everyone pick off the gooey pieces themselves.\u00a0Monkey bread tastes best served on the same day, but will stay fresh for 3 days if stored covered at room temperature or in the refrigerator."
