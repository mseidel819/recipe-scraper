    "description": "This is my go-to pumpkin Bundt cake recipe because the crumb is incredibly moist, the cake tastes perfectly spiced, and you can top it with anything from salted caramel sauce to cream cheese frosting. You can fill it with chocolate chips, a cinnamon swirl, nuts, or leave it plain. I particularly love it plain with the maple icing from these maple brown sugar cookies on top!",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 and 3/4 cups (344g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)",
      "2 teaspoons baking soda",
      "1/2 teaspoon salt",
      "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
      "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger",
      "1/2 teaspoon ground cloves",
      "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg",
      "1/2 teaspoon ground\u00a0allspice",
      "1 cup (240ml) vegetable oil or olive oil*",
      "4 large eggs",
      "1 cup (200g) packed light or dark brown sugar",
      "3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar",
      "1 15-ounce (425g) can pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)*",
      "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "optional add-in: 1 and 1/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips or chopped walnuts/pecans",
      "optional topping: salted caramel, maple icing, or any listed below",
      "optional garnish: sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) and grease a 10\u201312-cup Bundt pan. (I like this one or this one.)",
      "Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice together in a large bowl. Set aside. Whisk the oil, eggs, brown sugar, granulated sugar, pumpkin, and vanilla extract together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and use a mixer or whisk until completely combined. Fold in chocolate chips or nuts, if using. Batter is thick, and you\u2019ll have around 5 cups total.",
      "Spoon/pour the batter into the prepared Bundt pan. Bake for 55\u201370 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean with just a couple lightly moist crumbs. This is a large, heavy cake so don\u2019t be alarmed if it takes a little longer in your oven.",
      "Once done, remove from the oven and allow to cool for 2 hours in the pan set on a wire rack. Then invert the slightly cooled Bundt cake onto a wire rack or serving plate/cake stand.",
      "Allow to cool completely before drizzling with topping/icing and serving. On the pictured cake, I used the maple icing from these maple brown sugar cookies. I also sprinkled a homemade pumpkin pie spice blend on top of the icing before it set.",
      "Cover leftover cake\u00a0tightly and store at room temperature for a couple days and/or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: You can make the entire cake ahead of time (before topping with icing). Cover cooled cake and refrigerate it for up to 2 days. Bring to room temperature before icing and serving. Baked cake can be frozen for up to 3 months. Allow to thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before icing and serving.",

      "Mini Bundt Cakes: I\u2019ve tested this recipe with mini Bundt pans before and while the mini Bundt cakes taste wonderful, they\u2019re quite dense. If you\u2019d like to try it, the recipe makes 24-30 mini Bundts but that depends on the exact size of your mini Bundt cake pan. Fill them only halfway with batter. The bake time is around 20 to 25 minutes. Instead, for better results with a lighter crumb, I recommend using my pumpkin cupcakes batter for mini pumpkin Bundt cakes. You\u2019ll get about 16.",
      "Spices: Instead of 1/2 teaspoon each ginger, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice, you can use 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. (You will still add the 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon.)",
      "Oil: Instead of 1 cup of oil, try 1/2 cup (90g) unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 (120ml) cup oil. The cake is just as moist. If you want to use coconut oil, melt it first, and be sure that all of the other ingredients are room temperature. Bake the batter right away, because as the coconut oil begins to cool and solidify, it thickens the batter and could result in an overly dense cake.",
      "Pumpkin: For best results and flavor, I strongly recommend using canned pumpkin puree over homemade in this recipe. I found the flavor is much better with canned. I prefer Libby\u2019s brand for this cake.",

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until combined. Batter is creamy and slightly thick. You will have just over 3 cups of batter.",
      "In a medium bowl, toss the peach slices with 1 Tablespoon of sugar to coat. Divide in half, moving half of the peaches to another bowl. Add cinnamon to one half of the peaches and gently stir to coat. The cinnamon is optional. You could also toss ALL of the peaches in the cinnamon; I like to toss only half so the center of the cake has plenty of cinnamon swirls.",
      "Pour and spread half the batter (just eyeball it) into the prepared pan. Place the cinnamon-sugared peaches in an even layer on top. Spread the remaining batter on top of the cinnamon peach layer. Place remaining sugared peaches on top.",
      "Bake for 50\u201355 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Around the 30-minute mark, loosely tent with aluminum foil to prevent over-browning.",
      "Remove the cake from the oven and set the pan on a wire rack. Allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing, or cool completely. Dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar, if desired, before serving.",
      "Cover leftovers and store at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If you topped with a dusting of confectioners\u2019 sugar, note that the sugar will melt and disappear into the cake after a few hours."

      "Can I Make This in a Different Pan? The recipe is designed for a 9-inch springform pan, but you could also use a 10-inch cast iron skillet. A 9-inch or 10-inch square baking pan work too. I also have a recipe for a peach Bundt cake, and a peach quick bread if you want to try those instead.",
      "Yogurt: I tested this cake with nonfat and low-fat Greek yogurt, regular yogurt, and sour cream\u2014all were excellent. Greek yogurt added a little more tang and structure, though. You could also use a dairy-free yogurt to make this cake dairy free.",
      "Peaches: Fresh peaches are the best option for this fresh peach cake. If you must use frozen peach slices, thaw and then blot them dry before using. Canned peaches would be fine in a pinch, but the texture is much better with fresh. If using canned, be sure to drain and blot dry first."

Each layer of graham crackers is about 7 graham crackers (you can break some up to fit). This recipe yields 6 cups of whipped cream and you will use 2 cups per layer.",

      "Spread a couple Tablespoons into a very, very thin layer on the bottom of an ungreased 9\u00d713-inch pan. This will help the bottom layer of graham crackers stick. Layer graham crackers on top, breaking them apart as needed to make 1 even layer.",

If you want that extra vanilla bean flavor, feel free to add the seeds scraped from 1/2 of a vanilla bean. (This is in addition to the liquid vanilla extract.)",
      "Graham Crackers: Don\u2019t have graham crackers where you live? You can substitute digestive biscuits or Biscoff cookies, if you have either of those options. Use however many will fit for each layer.",

You can replace a small amount of the oil with applesauce if needed, but keep in mind that the cake will begin to taste dry/rubbery the more oil you replace.",
      "Applesauce: It\u2019s best to use unsweetened applesauce in this recipe\u2014you need a wet ingredient that won\u2019t overpower the other flavors in the cake. Feel free to use mashed banana or canned crushed pineapple instead, but keep in mind that the flavor of the cake will change.",
      "Brown Butter: For more information and troubleshooting, see this post on how to brown butter.",
      "Layer Cake: Grease three 8-inch or 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. Divide batter between the three round cake pans. Bake for about 26\u201332 minutes, depending on which size pan you used. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Use the brown butter cream cheese frosting recipe/ratios from this banana layer cake so you have enough.",
      "Bundt Cake: This cake batter will fit into a greased 10-cup or larger Bundt pan. Bake at 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) for 55\u201370 minutes. The baking time varies depending on your oven; keep your eye on the cake after 55 minutes. Feel free to cover the cake loosely with aluminum foil about halfway through to prevent heavy browning on top. Allow the cake to cool in the pan set on a wire rack, then invert onto a serving plate once cooled and ready to serve.",

Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed.",
      "Whisk the lemon juice and milk together. With the mixer running on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 3 additions, alternating with the lemon-milk mixture and mixing after each addition until just incorporated. Do not over-mix. The batter will be thick and fluffy. Fold in the coconut.",

Serve immediately or refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 24 hours. If the cake has been refrigerated for longer than an hour, let it sit out at room temperature for about 30 minutes before serving, to soften up a bit.",

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: You can make and cool the cake 1 day before serving, store covered overnight, and decorate and serve the following day. You can also make and decorate the cake 1 day in advance; see step 8. To freeze, wrap unfrosted baked and cooled cake in 1\u20132 layers of plastic wrap, then a layer of aluminum foil.

      "Toasted Coconut for Topping: If desired, you can toast some or all of the coconut for the topping. Spread the coconut on an ungreased baking sheet, and bake in a 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C) oven for 6\u20138 minutes, or until browned to your liking. Let cool before using.",
      "Can I Use Another Frosting? If you don\u2019t want a cream cheese frosting, this lemon buttercream would be so tasty, and you can halve the recipe to make just enough for the Bundt.",
      "Can I Use Another Flavor Bundt Cake? Yes, you can use this frosting and decorating technique with another flavor Bundt cake such as cheesecake swirl carrot Bundt cake, chocolate marble banana Bundt cake, lemon berry yogurt cake, and cream cheese pound cake.",

The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (Note: Even if they\u2019re completely done, the cooled cakes may slightly sink in the center.

      "Make the cake:\u00a0Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk), mix the oil, eggs, and sour cream together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the buttermilk and vanilla and beat until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is completely combined. Fold in the flour-coated chocolate chips. Batter is thin and you may see some air bubbles on the surface\u2014that\u2019s normal. You should have about 6\u20136.5 cups of batter, or around 1400g.\u00a0",
      "Divide batter evenly between 3 pans. Bake for approximately 24\u201326 minutes. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.",
      "Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely in the pan. The cakes may slightly sink in the middle as they cool\u2014that\u2019s expected.",
      "As the cakes cool, make the chocolate buttercream: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, cocoa powder, heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Taste. Beat in another pinch of salt if desired. (Do you want your buttercream darker in color? I have a trick detailed on the full chocolate buttercream page.) You\u2019re going to use this buttercream for a thin layer under the raspberry filling, a piped \u201cdam\u201d around 2 of the cake layers, and for the crumb coat. Makes about 2.5 cups total.",
      "Begin layering with raspberry filling and buttercream: Place 1 cooled cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Using a\u00a0large icing spatula or small offset spatula, evenly cover the top with about 1/4 cup of chocolate buttercream frosting (a thin layer). Spoon about 1/2 cup of the chocolate buttercream into a piping bag fitted with a large round piping tip. I use Wilton 2A. (Or just use a disposable piping bag and cut about 3/4 inch off the tip and use that without a piping tip.) Pipe a thick border of buttercream around the edge of the frosted cake layer, using about half of the buttercream in the piping bag. Then, using a small offset spatula, spread half of the thickened and chilled raspberry filling (about 1/2 cup) inside the buttercream border. Place second cake layer on top and then repeat the filling process: spread frosting, pipe border with remaining frosting in piping bag (if you ran out, just use more from the big bowl of buttercream), then spread on remaining raspberry filling. Top with third cake layer.",
      "Apply crumb coat: Using the remaining chocolate buttercream, spread a thin layer of buttercream on the top and around the sides as a crumb coat. Run a bench scraper around the cake to smooth out crumb coat. Chill uncovered in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours to set the crumb coat.",
      "As your crumb coat sets, make and chill the chocolate ganache: Place finely chopped chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl. Heat the cream and raspberry liqueur, if using, in a small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to gently simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil\u2014that\u2019s too hot!) Pour over chocolate, then let it sit for 2\u20133 minutes to gently soften the chocolate. With a metal spoon or small rubber spatula, very slowly stir until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth. Ganache is thin. The finer you chopped the chocolate, the quicker it will melt with the cream. If it\u2019s not melting, do not microwave it. If needed, see Troubleshooting Chocolate Ganache. Once ganache mixture is smooth, let it chill for 30 minutes in the refrigerator to thicken before spreading on chilled crumb-coated cake.",
      "Pour/spoon thickened ganache on chilled cake, and spread all over cake with an icing spatula. Garnish with fresh raspberries, if desired. Serve cake immediately or chill, uncovered, for up to 4\u20136 hours before serving. Cake can be served at room temperature or chilled.",
      "Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days. I like using a cake carrier for storing and transporting."

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions for Cake:\u00a0Prepare cake through step 6. Wrap the individual baked and cooled cake layers tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze up to 3 months. Bring to room temperature, then continue with step 7. You can prepare the raspberry filling and chocolate buttercream in advance. See step 2 for raspberry sauce details. For the buttercream, cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before using and beat in a little more room-temperature heavy cream to thin out if necessary. You can also prepare the chocolate ganache ahead of time. Refrigerate prepared ganache for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before spreading onto cake. Frosted cake freezes well, up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature or serve cold.",
      "Freezing Instructions for Raspberry Filling: After the raspberry filling cools completely, freeze in a freezer-friendly container for up to 3\u20136 months. Thaw on the counter or in the refrigerator before using. It will be very thick.",

      "Cocoa Powder: This recipe requires natural cocoa powder for its acidity, so do not use dutch-process.",
      "Espresso Powder/Coffee:\u00a0Espresso powder and coffee will not make the cake taste like coffee. Rather, they deepen the chocolate flavor. I highly recommend them both. If coffee isn\u2019t your thing, you can leave out the espresso powder and use extra hot water instead of the hot coffee.",
      "Sour Cream: Instead of sour cream, you can use plain yogurt. The cake won\u2019t taste as rich, but it\u2019s a fine substitute.",
      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk is required for this recipe. You can make your own DIY version of buttermilk if needed. Add 1 teaspoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1/2 cup (120ml). (In a pinch, lower-fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe.",
      "Why Room Temperature? All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter and frosting mix together easily and evenly. Read more about why room temperature ingredients are important.",
      "Chocolate Raspberry Ganache: Feel free to replace the raspberry liqueur with 1/4 cup (60ml) more heavy cream to make a plain chocolate ganache instead. When melting chocolate, I recommend using pure chocolate baking bars (chocolate chips have stabilizers). You can find them right next to the chocolate chips in the baking aisle. I like Bakers or Ghirardelli brands, the ones labeled bittersweet (60% cacao) or semi-sweet (56% cacao), which come in 4-ounce (113g) bars.",
      "6-Inch Cake:\u00a0To make a scaled-down 3-layer 6-inch version of this cake, use this batter for chocolate cupcakes and follow my 6-inch cake baking instructions and details. I recommend using the same amount of raspberry filling, and having some left over. Use about 1/3 cup between the layers. You can halve the buttercream and ganache recipes.",

      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease three 8-inch or 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)",
      "Make the cake: Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed for 5 full minutes until completely creamed together and fluffy. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil and beat for 1 minute until combined. Add the eggs, egg whites, and vanilla extract and beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.",
      "Add dry ingredients and buttermilk in three additions, mixing after each addition just until incorporated. Do not over-mix this batter. The batter will be velvety and thick. Gently fold in the sprinkles. Pour and spread the batter evenly into each cake pan.",
      "Bake for around 25\u201326 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. (8-inch cakes may take about 27\u201328 minutes.) Tent the cakes with foil after about 15 minutes to prevent the sides and top from over-browning. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it\u2019s done.",
      "Allow cakes to cool in the pans set on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Run a knife around the edges and then remove cakes from pans. Place cakes directly on wire racks to cool completely. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Make the frosting:\u00a0In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds and then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Add more confectioners\u2019 sugar if frosting seems too thin; more cream if frosting is too thick; or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.",
      "Assemble cake + apply crumb coat: First, using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place one cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Using a large icing spatula or small offset spatula, evenly cover the top with about 1 cup (about 250g) of frosting. Repeat with second cake layer, 1 more cup of frosting, and then the top cake layer. Spread a thin layer of frosting on the top and around the sides as a crumb coat. Run a bench scraper around the cake to smooth out crumb coat. Chill uncovered in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours to set the crumb coat.",
      "Spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides. Garnish with extra sprinkles, if desired.",

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared and then covered and refrigerated overnight. When ready to decorate, let the frosting sit at room temperature to slightly soften for 15 minutes, then give it one more mix with the mixer on medium speed for about 1 minute before frosting cake. (Add a splash of cream to thin out frosting if needed.) See step 10 if you want to store the frosted/decorated cake before serving it. Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers can be frozen for up to 2\u20133 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving.

      "2022 Update: Recipe above was slightly updated in 2022. Old version used to call for 3 sticks (about 345g) of butter and no oil. The slight reduction of butter and added oil makes a moister cake, but feel free to use the old version. Also, the extra egg whites are now added when you add the whole eggs. You used to have to whip them separately until soft peaks form and then fold them in before adding the sprinkles. This step isn\u2019t really necessary because we\u2019re using a little oil and cake flour now. (See next Note.)",
      "Eggs:\u00a04 whole eggs provide structure, moisture, and richness. 2 extra egg whites keep the cake light. I don\u2019t recommend using 5 whole eggs as a replacement; stick to the 4 eggs + 2 egg whites combination.",

The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe.",
      "Sprinkles: Avoid using sprinkles that will dye your batter. Steer clear of nonpareils, which are the little balls. The pictured cake uses Betty Crocker \u201cParlor Perfect\u201d rainbow sprinkles, which I find in my regular grocery store. I also like to use these rainbow jimmies or confetti quins. Note that naturally colored sprinkles may lose their color in cake batter.",
      "Chocolate Frosting: Use the frosting from this pi\u00f1ata cake recipe. It makes\u00a0enough for this size cake.",
      "Amount of Cake Batter & Other Size Cakes:\u00a0This recipe yields nearly 8 cups of batter, which is helpful if you need it for different Cake Pan Sizes & Conversions. For a 1-layer cake, 12\u00d717-inch sheet cake, or 6-inch layer cake, see the list of recipe links in the post, above the recipe card. For a 2-layer cake, divide batter between 2 9-inch cake pans instead of 3. (This is too much batter for 2 8-inch pans.) Increase bake time to about 30 minutes and use a toothpick to test for doneness. For a Bundt cake, use a 10\u201312-cup generously greased Bundt pan and bake for about 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. There is too much batter for a 9\u00d713-inch quarter sheet cake. I have 2 recipes on my website that would work for a 9\u00d713-inch sprinkle cake. You could use this light and fluffy white cake recipe and fold 1/2 cup (about 90g) sprinkles into the batter before pouring into the pan. See those recipe Notes for a 9\u00d713-inch cake. Or you can use this buttery sprinkle sheet cake recipe. See those recipe Notes for a 9\u00d713-inch cake.",
      "Cupcakes: Use this batter for 3 dozen sprinkle cupcakes. Fill cupcake liners about 2/3 full to avoid over-flowing. Or use my confetti sprinkle cupcakes or funfetti cupcakes recipes."

      "Peanut Butter: To prevent the frosting from separating or coming out too thin or oily, use processed creamy peanut butter such as Jif or Skippy.",
      "Why Room Temperature? All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter and frosting mix together easily and evenly. Read more about why room temperature ingredients are important.",
      "Chocolate Ganache: You can use high-quality dark or semi-sweet chocolate chips if needed, but when melting chocolate, I recommend using pure chocolate baking bars (chocolate chips have stabilizers). You can find them right next to the chocolate chips in the baking aisle. I like Bakers or Ghirardelli brands, the ones labeled semi-sweet (56% cacao), which come in 4-ounce (113g) bars.",
      "Cupcakes: Here\u2019s a very similar recipe for dark chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter frosting. Feel free to fill them with the peanut butter frosting (instead of frosting them with it) and top each with chocolate ganache."

    "instructions": [
      "Read through the full directions and watch my Elmo Cake video tutorial before beginning. (Same method here, just no nose.) If you wish to make the cake ahead of time, read my Make-Ahead Instructions below before beginning.",
      "Make the cakes: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes\u00a0video & post.)",
      "Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the egg whites, sour cream, and vanilla. Beat on high speed until fully combined and mixed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Pour the dry ingredients into the bowl. Then with the mixer running on low, slowly pour in the milk. Do not over-mix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.",
      "Toss mini chocolate chips with 1 Tablespoon of cake flour to coat them and then fold into the batter.",
      "Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 25-26 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is done. Cool cakes in the pans set on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then remove the cakes and cool completely directly on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Make the buttercream: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, milk/cream, vanilla extract, and salt with the mixer running on low. Increase to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes. Taste. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is way too sweet. Frosting will be thick.",
      "Tint the frosting:\u00a0Place 1 cup + 2 Tablespoons (about 1 heaping cup or 275g) of frosting into a medium bowl. This will remain white/untinted and be used for the cake\u2019s filling and to form Cookie Monster\u2019s eyes. Place 1/3 cup (about 85g) of frosting into a small bowl. Stir in 3 drops of black gel food coloring until it\u2019s dark gray. (Keep in mind that frosting dries darker.) Tint the remaining frosting blue using about 4-5 big drops of blue gel food coloring. Tint until you are satisfied with the color. Remember, frosting dries darker, and we\u2019re going for lighter Cookie Monster blue, not darker Grover blue!",
      "Level the cakes & add the crumb coat: Using a large serrated knife, slice the domes off the cooled cakes (a semi-thin layer) to create a flat surface. Place tops into a bowl to use in step 10. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, serving plate, or cake turntable. Spread 1 cup (about 250g) of white untinted frosting all over the top. (Reserve remaining white frosting for step 10.) Top with 2nd layer. Spread a thin layer of blue frosting around the sides and top of the cake. This is your crumb coat and should be a pretty thin layer. An icing spatula and bench scraper are helpful for this. Chill uncovered in the refrigerator or freezer for at least 30 minutes to help set the crumb coat.",
      "Meanwhile, shape Cookie Monster\u2019s eyes: Crumble the pieces of cake that you leveled off into crumbs. I just use my hands for this. Stir in 1 Tablespoon of white frosting. If the mixture still seems pretty crumby and dry, add a little more of the white frosting until you have a moist mixture that you can form into shapes. Mixture shouldn\u2019t be overly wet. Form into two 2-inch discs. Smooth them out as best you can. Place on a lined baking sheet and chill in the refrigerator or freezer for at least 30 minutes to set. Once they\u2019re set, you can smooth out any bumps on the surface with your hands if needed.",
      "Meanwhile, pipe Cookie Monster\u2019s fur: First, spread a thin layer of black frosting on the bottom half of the top of the cake. Use a small offset spatula to help ensure it\u2019s perfectly smooth. Reserve remaining black frosting. Using a toothpick, trace/outline Cookie\u2019s mouth shape within the black frosting. Use it as your guide for piping his fur around it. Fit your piping bag with Wilton piping tip #233 (grass tip). Spoon some blue frosting inside. It\u2019s difficult to pipe this frosting if the bag is over-filled, so just work with a little bit of frosting in the bag at a time. Place the tip directly on top of the cake\u2019s surface and apply pressure to squeeze the frosting out of the tip. Quickly lift the tip up while squeezing the frosting out. Pipe his fur all over the top and sides of the cake. (The sides are optional, but if you have enough frosting, go for it!) It\u2019s helpful to carefully tilt the cake stand/turntable so you can more easily pipe frosting on the sides. Set cake aside. You can refrigerate uncovered if desired as you finish Cookie\u2019s eyes.",
      "Coat the eyes: Melt the white chocolate and oil together in a double boiler or the microwave. If using the microwave: place the chopped chocolate and oil in a medium heat-proof bowl. Microwave for 20-second increments, stirring after each time, until completely melted and smooth. Place one of the discs (eyes) into the white chocolate. Use a fork to help fully coat it. Using a fork, lift the disc (eye) out of the chocolate. Place back onto lined baking sheet. Repeat with 2nd disc (eye). Refrigerate or freeze for 20 minutes or until white chocolate has set.",
      "Finishing touches: After the white chocolate sets, fit your piping bag with Wilton tip #12 (round tip). Spoon some black frosting inside. Pipe Cookie Monster\u2019s pupils onto the eyes\u2014remember to make them off-center and \u201cgoogly\u201d. Carefully press the eyes on top of the cake to form Cookie\u2019s face. If desired, add chocolate chip cookies around the cake and in his mouth, see Note.",
      "Serve & store: If you decorated the cake on a cake turntable, use a couple thin spatulas (and a helper!) to carefully lift the cake off the turntable and onto a cake stand, server, or cake carrier base. I actually like to use a cake carrier to cover and store my cakes in the refrigerator.",
      "Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make-Ahead Instructions: You can prepare the cake layers ahead of time. Wrap the individual baked and cooled cake layers tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 days. You can also assemble the cake with Cookie Monster\u2019s mouth & piped fur 2 days ahead of time, too. You can also make, coat in white chocolate, cover, and refrigerate his eyes ahead of time as well. Do not place on cake until the day of serving as the blue from Cookie\u2019s fur may smear onto the eyes. Pipe his pupils the day of serving because the black can smear down onto his eyes if refrigerated ahead of time. It did this for me, so I just carefully wiped it off.",
      "Freezing Instructions: Freeze the cake layers for up to 3 months. See How to Freeze Cake for instructions. Bring cake layers to room temperature, then continue with step 7.",
      "Recommended Tools (affiliate links): 9-inch Cake Pans | Electric Mixer (Handheld or Stand) | Grass Tip |\u00a0Round Tip | Piping Bags (Disposable or Reusable) | Toothpick | Cake Turntable\u00a0| Small Offset Spatula | Large Icing Spatula | Bench Scraper | Blue & Black Gel Food Coloring | Cake Carrier (for storage)",
      "Whole Milk & Sour Cream: Whole milk and sour cream are strongly recommended for the best taste and texture. A full fat plain yogurt would work instead, though the cake may not be as light. Same goes with a lower fat milk.",
      "White Chocolate: Use real white chocolate to coat the eyes. You can use high-quality white chocolate chips if needed (I prefer Ghirardelli brand), but I recommend using pure chocolate baking bars. You can find them right next to the chocolate chips in the baking aisle. They are sold in 4-ounce (113g) bars. I like Bakers or Ghirardelli brands. You can also use 4 ounces of white candy melts.",
      "Food Coloring: Use gel, not liquid, food coloring. I recommend Americolor brand in royal blue and black. If you\u2019d like to use natural food coloring, I like the brand Supernatural; they have some powdered food coloring that works well in frosting.",
      "Serving: This cake serves about 12 people, but I served nearly 20 people (10 adults and 10 kids). Cut thin slices.",
      "Cookies for Garnish: Use this recipe for mini M&M cookies, swapping mini chocolate chips for the mini M&Ms. For full-size cookies, use this recipe for chocolate chip cookies."

    "ingredients": [
      "10 Tablespoons (140g) unsalted butter",
      "4 large egg whites (140g), at room temperature",
      "1 cup (105g) almond flour",
      "2/3 cup (85g) all-purpose flour",
      "3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar",
      "1/2 teaspoon baking powder",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt",

      "optional: 1/4 cup (30g) confectioners\u2019 sugar for dusting on top"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Brown the butter: Set out a medium heat-proof bowl because you\u2019ll need it at the end of this step. Slice the butter into Tablespoon-size pieces and place in a light-colored skillet or saucepan. A light-colored interior is crucial for determining when the butter begins to brown. (See Notes if using a dark skillet or pan.) Melt the butter over medium heat and stir or whisk constantly. Once melted, the butter will begin to foam. Continue stirring/whisking, keeping a close eye on it. After about 5\u20137 minutes, the butter will begin browning and you\u2019ll notice lightly browned specks forming at the bottom of the pan. The butter will have a nutty aroma. The color will gradually deepen, from yellow to golden to golden-brown; once it\u2019s a light caramel-brown color, remove from heat immediately and pour into the bowl, including any brown solids that have formed on the bottom of the pan. Separate out 2 Tablespoons of brown butter\u2014we\u2019ll brush that in the muffin pans in step 2. Cool the remaining brown butter (about 1/2 cup) for 30 minutes in the refrigerator, or until room temperature and no longer warm. Don\u2019t cool longer than that because the butter will begin to solidify.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Using a pastry brush, brush the cups of a 24-count mini muffin pan with the 2 Tablespoons of browned butter. This recipe yields 30\u201336 tea cakes, so grease a 2nd pan or bake the batter in batches. If using mini muffin liners, brush the liners with the brown butter.",
      "Make the tea cakes: Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the egg whites on high speed in a large bowl until soft peaks form, about 2\u20133 minutes. Add the almond flour, all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, and lemon zest. Beat on low speed until combined and don\u2019t worry that the egg whites deflate, you\u2019ll still taste their fluffy goodness in the cakes! Mixture will be sticky, lumpy, and thick. Pour in the vanilla extract and cooled brown butter and beat on low speed until combined.",
      "Spoon 2 teaspoons of batter into each greased muffin cup. Lightly poke a berry into the center of each. No need to submerge the berry, just stick it on top.",
      "Bake for 14\u201316 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing. Tea cakes will slightly deflate as they cool.",
      "If desired, lightly sift confectioners\u2019 sugar on warm or cooled tea cakes before serving.",
      "Tea cakes are best enjoyed the day they are made. Store leftover tea cakes covered lightly at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: Baked and cooled tea cakes can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight on the counter before dusting with confectioners\u2019 sugar and serving.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Light-Colored Skillet (like this or this)| Whisk | 24-Cup Mini Muffin Pan | Pastry Brush | Electric Mixer (Handheld or Stand) | Fine Mesh Sieve",
      "Using a regular 12-count muffin pan: Makes 10 tea cakes. Use a scant 2 Tablespoons of batter per tea cake and 2 berries on top. Extend the bake time to 18\u201321 minutes or until the edges are golden brown.",
      "Browning butter in a darker skillet/pan: I recommend using a light-colored skillet or large pot when browning butter so you can see when the butter is browned. (It\u2019s only a few quick seconds between brown butter and burnt butter.) If you only have dark cookware, I suggest setting a timer, and checking the color by spooning some butter into a glass bowl to determine if it has browned. Check it at the 5-minute mark, then every minute after. Don\u2019t let it cook longer than 8 minutes.",
      "Almond flour: Almond flour is finely ground blanched almonds. You could also use almond meal, which is coarser. You can make your own almond flour, but be very careful because almonds can quickly release their oils, clump up, and turn into almond butter. It might be easier to just pick up a bag of fine almond flour. It\u2019s common in grocery stores these days\u2014I use and love Bob\u2019s Red Mill brand.",
      "Can I make these without almond flour? We weren\u2019t able to successfully make these without almond flour without the texture completely changing. Instead, I recommend making these almond poppy seed tea cakes. You can leave out the almond extract and poppy seeds, if needed/desired, and pop a berry into the tops before baking like you do with today\u2019s recipe. See Notes in that recipe for using a mini muffin pan.",
      "Berries: You can use frozen berries instead of fresh, but be sure to thaw them first. I recommend blackberries, raspberries, or blueberries. You need 30\u201336 individual berries. If your blueberries are small, use 2 per tea cake."

    "description": "You\u2019ll love this buttery and moist marble loaf cake because it\u2019s easy to make, assemble, and serve without any fancy decoration. The chocolate batter is made from the vanilla, so you don\u2019t have to prepare two separate cake recipes. Review the recipe notes before beginning.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 cups (255g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)",
      "1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt",
      "1/2 cup (1 stick; 115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
      "1 cup (200g) granulated sugar",
      "1/3 cup (80ml) vegetable oil",
      "2 large eggs, at room temperature",
      "1/4 cup (60g) full-fat\u00a0sour cream, at room temperature",
      "1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extract (yes, 1 Tbsp!)",
      "2/3 cup + 2 Tablespoons (190ml) whole milk, divided and at room temperature",
      "3 Tablespoons (16g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder",
      "optional but recommended: 1/2 teaspoon espresso powder",
      "one\u00a04-ounce (113g) quality\u00a0semi-sweet chocolate bar, finely chopped (see note)",
      "6 Tablespoons (90ml) heavy cream\u00a0or\u00a0heavy whipping cream (see note)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) and generously grease a 9\u00d75-inch loaf pan.",
      "Make the cake batter: Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil and beat until combined. The mixture will still be quite creamy. Add the eggs and beat on high speed for 1 minute and then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. The mixture will be lumpy\u2013 that\u2019s ok. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer to low speed and as the mixer runs, slowly pour in 2/3 cup (160ml) milk. Beat on low speed just until all of the ingredients are combined. Do not over-mix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no large lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.",
      "You\u2019ll have around 3-3.5 cups of batter. Transfer a little less than half (just eyeball it, doesn\u2019t need to be perfect) to another bowl. Stir in the remaining 2 Tablespoons (30ml) milk, the cocoa powder, and espresso powder.",
      "Layer and swirl the batters: Spread a thin layer of the plain vanilla batter in the bottom of your prepared loaf pan. Now you will layer spoonfuls of each batter on top\u2014cover bottom vanilla layer with a few spoonfuls of the chocolate batter, then a few spoonfuls of the vanilla batter, then more chocolate batter, then more vanilla batter, and so on until all of the cake batter is used. Gently shimmy the pan to level out the batters. Using a knife, make rounded horizontal zig-zags from one side of the pan to the other and then make rounded vertical zig-zags from the top to the bottom.",
      "Bake for about 65-75 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. That time is a guideline\u2014 all ovens differ, so keep a close eye on the cake\u00a0after 55 minutes. If the cake is browning too quickly on top, loosely tent with aluminum foil as it bakes.",
      "Cool cake in the pan set on a wire rack for 30 minutes before removing from the pan. Note that the cake slightly sinks as it cools and that\u2019s completely normal. Feel free to continue cooling the cake directly on a wire rack or you can top it and slice it while it\u2019s still slightly warm after 30 minutes cooling inside the pan.",
      "As the cake cools, make the ganache topping: Place the chocolate and cream in a medium heat-safe bowl set over a medium saucepan of simmering water. (Or use a double boiler if you have one.) Do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water. Stir frequently until chocolate has melted and ganache is smooth. Remove from heat and set aside at room temperature for 20-30 minutes or until slightly thickened.\u00a0",
      "Drizzle or spread topping on cake. Topping sets into a fudge-like consistency after several hours.",
      "Cover leftovers tightly and store cake (with or without topping) at room temperature for 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions:\u00a0Topped or plain cake freezes well up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature or serve cold.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): 9\u00d75-inch Loaf Pan | Glass Mixing Bowl | Whisk | Electric Mixer (Handheld or Stand) | Cooling Rack",
      "Oil:\u00a0For best taste and texture, use vegetable oil. In a pinch, you can replace with canola oil or olive oil. The cake can taste greasy with melted coconut oil, but if you try it, it\u2019s imperative the other ingredients are room temperature so the coconut oil doesn\u2019t solidify as you mix the batter together.",
      "Whole Milk &\u00a0Sour Cream: Feel free to replace the sour cream with low fat plain yogurt. For best results, use whole milk. Lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch. I don\u2019t recommend replacing the sour cream and/or milk with buttermilk in this recipe.",
      "Room Temperature Ingredients: All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly. Read more about room temperature ingredients in baking.",
      "Espresso Powder:\u00a0Espresso powder will not make the cake taste like coffee. Instead, it deepens the chocolate flavor. It\u2019s optional, but for best taste, I highly recommend it. You can use the same amount of instant coffee (the powder) instead of espresso powder if desired.",
      "Ganache Topping: For the pictured ganache topping, I used 4 ounces of a milk chocolate baking bar from Trader Joes called \u201cMilk Chocolate Pound Plus.\u201d Milk chocolate is softer than semi-sweet and thus produces a thinner ganache. If you use milk chocolate, sometimes sold as \u201csweet chocolate\u201d or \u201cGerman\u2019s chocolate\u201d by the brand Bakers, reduce the heavy cream down to 1/4 cup (4 Tbsp; 60ml). If using semi-sweet chocolate, use 6 Tablespoons (90ml) heavy cream as listed above to produce a nice thick ganache."

In another large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold the ingredients together until just combined. Fold in the carrots and pecans. You will have about 6 cups of batter. Pour and spread half of the batter into the bottom of the prepared Bundt pan.",

To freeze, cool cake completely, wrap tightly, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature if desired before serving.",

      "Oil: This recipe is best with vegetable oil. You can use melted and slightly cooled coconut oil if desired, but be sure that all other ingredients are room temperature so the coconut oil does not solidify before baking the batter.",
      "Applesauce: Instead of applesauce, you can use 3/4 cup canned crushed pineapple.",
      "Cream Cheese: Do not use cream cheese spread. Use brick cream cheese which is sold as 8 ounce bricks. You need 1.5 bricks since this recipe calls for 12 ounces of cream cheese.",
      "Pecans & Other Add Ins: You can add up to 1 and 1/4 cups add-ins to this cake. I usually use just 1 cup\u00a0(130g) roughly chopped pecans. You can use raisins, chopped walnuts, and/or shredded coconut (sweetened or unsweetened). A combination of any works as long as the total amount isn\u2019t over 1 and 1/4 cups.

      "Loaf Pan: Some readers have halved this recipe and baked it in a loaf pan at the same oven temperature for about 1 hour, though my team and I have not tested it. You could also try this carrot cake loaf instead."

    "instructions": [
      "Make the lemon curd:\u00a0Fill the bottom pot of your\u00a0double boiler with 1-2 inches of water. (Or use the DIY double boiler method listed in the notes.) Place on high heat. Once the water begins to boil, reduce to low heat to keep the water at a simmer. Place egg yolks, egg, granulated sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt into the top pot of your double boiler. Using a silicone whisk (avoid metal because it leaves an aftertaste), whisk until completely blended and then continue to whisk as the curd cooks. Whisk and cook until the mixture becomes thick and is the consistency of hollandaise sauce or a really thick soup, about 10 minutes or when an instant read thermometer reaches 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C). If curd isn\u2019t thickening, turn up the heat and constantly whisk. Remove pan from heat. Cut the butter into 6 separate pieces and then whisk into the curd until butter has melted and combined. Pour curd into a jar or bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top so it is touching the top of the curd. This prevents a skin from forming on top. The curd will continue to thicken as it cools. Place in refrigerator to speed up cooling. Once cool, the plastic wrap can be removed. Refrigerate the curd for up to about 10 days or for longer storage, you can freeze the cooled curd for up to 3-6 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before enjoying. Makes 1 heaping cup.",
      "Make the cake: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease three 6-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes\u00a0video & post.)",
      "Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula and then add the citrus zest. Beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla extract. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. Add half of the flour mixture (just eyeball it), half of the milk, and half of the citrus juice. Beat on low speed until mostly combined, and then add the remaining flour mixture, milk, and citrus juice. Beat on low speed until combined. Do not over-mix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no large lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick with some small lumps. You will have between 3.5 \u2013 4 cups of batter.",
      "Divide and pour batter evenly into cake pans. If batter appears to have bubbles, give the pans a light tap on the counter to pop them. Bake cakes for 18-21 minutes or until baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it\u2019s done.",
      "Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Remove cakes from the pans and set them on a wire rack to cool completely. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Make the whipped frosting:\u00a0In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium-high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed until creamy. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar and vanilla extract, and then beat on medium speed until combined and completely smooth (absolutely no lumps), at least 2 full minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to smooth out. Switch to a whisk attachment (if you haven\u2019t already been using it). Turn the mixer to low speed and with the mixer running, carefully pour in the cream in a slow and steady stream. After all of the cream has been added, turn the mixer up to high speed and whip until thick and stiff peaks form, about 1-2 minutes. Do not walk away during this time and do not be concerned if your frosting takes longer to whip. You\u2019re looking for a thick, airy consistency with stiff peaks. If your frosting appears soupy now or at any point you are working with it, it needs more whipping to introduce more air. If your frosting appears chunky or curdled, it\u2019s over-whipped. To fix, stir 1 Tablespoon of heavy cream into the frosting by hand to smooth out again. You will have about 3.5 cups of frosting.",
      "Make lemon curd frosting filling: Spoon 1 cup of frosting (about 240ml) into a separate bowl. Stir in 3 heaping Tablespoons of cooled lemon curd. This will be your filling for the cake. Enjoy remaining lemon curd drizzled on the cake slices or as a topping on other baked goods.",
      "Assemble & crumb coat the cake: First, make sure you have enough room for the cake inside your refrigerator because it must chill at the end of this step and briefly in the next step as well. If the cake layers aren\u2019t flat on top, carefully and slowly level them off using a large serrated knife. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with 1/2 of the lemon curd frosting. Top with 2nd cake layer and evenly cover the top with remaining lemon curd frosting (if you have extras, just use it on the exterior of the cake). Top with the third cake layer. Spread a very thin layer of regular whipped frosting on top and all around the sides of the cake to create a crumb coat. A bench scraper\u00a0and\u00a0small icing spatula are handy for this. Refrigerate uncovered for 30 minutes.",
      "Add remaining frosting on chilled crumb-coated cake using\u00a0a small icing spatula or a larger flat icing spatula. Use a bench scraper, if desired, to smooth out the sides. Refrigerate the decorated cake uncovered for at least 30 minutes to help set the frosting. After that, if you used a cake turntable, you can carefully transfer the cake to a cake stand or serving plate using a couple flat spatulas.",
      "After 30 minutes in the refrigerator, the decorated cake is fine to slice and serve or sit out at room temperature for a few hours.\u00a0Cover leftover cake\u00a0tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: To make the lemon curd ahead of time or to freeze it, see end of step 1. The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Making the frosting ahead of time can be tricky because it doesn\u2019t sit well in the bowl overtime. Instead, make the frosting and use it immediately on the cake. After you finish decorating the cake in step 9, refrigerate for at least 30 minutes as instructed. You can extend this time up to 1 full day. After 2 hours, though, I recommend lightly covering the cake. (Note that covering this frosting can get messy and I haven\u2019t found a workaround for that.) Let cold cake sit at room temperature for about 1 hour before serving.",
      "Freezing Instructions: Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers can be frozen up to 2-3 months. To freeze the frosted cake, refrigerate for at least 1 hour to set the frosting, and then cover and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw your cake at room temperature.",

      "Eggs & Citrus in the Lemon Curd: I typically prepare lemon curd using 4 egg yolks, however I find the final consistency thicker when using 2 egg yolks and 1 whole egg\u2014that is reflected in the recipe above. You can make the lemon curd as written, but if you\u2019d like to switch citrus flavors, I recommend a 1:1 substitution with lime juice and zest. If you want to make grapefruit or orange curd, I recommend only substituting half of the lemon juice/zest. Make sure you use fresh-squeezed citrus.",
      "DIY Double Boiler for Curd:\u00a0If you do not own a double boiler, you can simply place a small heatproof glass bowl over a saucepan of simmering water\u2013 you will cook the curd in the top pot/bowl.",
      "Best Citrus to Use in Cake: This cake is best with just lemon, just lime, or a combination of both or either of those with another citrus such as orange, blood orange, or grapefruit. I don\u2019t recommend skipping the lemon or lime because other citrus flavors don\u2019t come through very much on their own. I like using an equal combination of lemon, lime, and orange.",
      "Cream Cheese in Frosting: Do not use cream cheese spread and do not use the entire 8 ounce brick\u2014you only need 6 ounces. Make sure it is full fat. I have best luck with Philadelphia brand cream cheese in this frosting.",
      "Amount of Cake Batter & Other Size Cakes or Cupcakes: This recipe yields between 3.5 \u2013 4 cups of batter, which is helpful if you need it for different Cake Pan Sizes & Conversions. Because of its light yet moist texture, this cake is best as a layer cake or as cupcakes. I have not tested this as a 1 layer 9-inch cake. For a\u00a03 layer 8-inch cake, I recommend making this lemon layer cake instead and scaling up the frosting by using one 8-ounce (225g) block cream cheese, 1 cup (120g) confectioners\u2019 sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, and 1 and 3/4 cups (420ml) heavy cream. Keep the lemon curd amount the same since this recipe makes plenty. Feel free to use a combination of citrus in that cake, but be warned that no flavor comes through quite like lemon. I strongly encourage you to keep that cake as a lemon flavored cake. For 1 dozen cupcakes, fill cupcake liners 2/3 full. Bake at 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) for 18-22 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the middle will come out clean when they\u2019re done. After cupcakes cool, carve a hole in the center (like I do for these chocolate covered strawberry cupcakes) and fill with 1 heaping teaspoon lemon curd. Top with whipped frosting. Feel free to mix some lemon curd into the frosting, too."

Do not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water. Stir frequently until chocolate has melted and ganache is smooth. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Set aside at room temperature to cool until thickened. You want it cool enough to not melt the frosting, but still a little fluid. This takes about 60-90 minutes to cool.

Place uncovered in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to help set the frosting. Pour ganache slowly on top of cake and use a small offset spatula or a knife to gently spread all over the frosting. Return cake to the refrigerator and chill uncovered for 30 minutes before slicing and serving. Feel free to garnish with mint leaves.",

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Prepare cake through step 4. Wrap the baked and cooled cake tightly and keep at room temperature for 1 day or freeze up to 3 months. Bring to room temperature (if frozen) then continue with step 5. Peppermint frosting can also be made 1 day ahead of time. Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight. Bring frosting to room temperature, and then beat the frosting on medium speed for a few seconds so it\u2019s creamy again. Adding a splash of milk will help thin the frosting out, if needed. You can also make the ganache 1 day in advance and cover and refrigerate, but you may need to slightly warm it again over a stove so it\u2019s slightly fluid again. Assembled/frosted cake freezes well, up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, and then bring to room temperature or serve cold. See How to Freeze Cakes.",

      "Chocolate in Ganache: You can use 2 cups of high quality dark chocolate chips or 3 4-ounce chocolate baking bars that you can find in the baking aisle such as Ghirardelli or Bakers brand. Semi-sweet or dark chocolate is fine.",
      "Salt in Ganache: I used 70% dark chocolate baking bars (found in the baking aisle), so I reduced the salt in Rebecca\u2019s recipe. If using very dark chocolate, you may want to keep the amount at 1/4 teaspoon. If using a sweeter chocolate, feel free to use 1/2 teaspoon as her recipe calls for.",
      "Shortening: If you do not have shortening, you can replace with the same amount of room temperature unsalted butter for a total of 1 cup (226g) butter in the peppermint frosting.",

      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until creamy and combined, about 2 minutes. On medium speed, add 1 egg at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla extract and sour cream.

(Mixture may appear curdled\u2013 that\u2019s ok.)\u00a0With the mixer on low speed, pour in the dry ingredients and milk/orange juice and beat until smooth and combined. Do not overmix. The batter will be thick. Fold in the cranberries and pecans. Spread into prepared pan. Set aside.",

      "Bake for 40-55 minutes. Baking times vary greatly depending on the pan you\u2019re using. A thick ceramic pan (as pictured) will take longer than a metal springform pan. Keep an eye on yours. The cake is done when the edges are browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If you find the top of the cake is browning too quickly in the oven, loosely cover it with aluminum foil.",
      "Remove the cake from the oven and set on a wire rack to cool for 10-15 minutes.",

Drizzle icing on cake, if it\u2019s plain, before serving.",
      "Baking Pan to Use (affiliate link): Use a baking dish that holds 2 quarts, such as a 9-inch square baking dish, 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan, or an 11\u00d77 inch pan. I do not recommend a 9-inch regular round cake pan because there is so much batter and even though it will fit, the batter will rise quite high and won\u2019t bake evenly. The pictured red ruffled baking dish is by the brand Emile Henry and comes in a set with others.",
      "Sour Cream: If you don\u2019t have sour cream, you can use plain regular or Greek yogurt instead. I don\u2019t suggest subbing the sour cream with a liquid.",
      "Cranberries: If using dried instead of fresh or frozen, reduce down to 1 cup (140g) dried cranberries.",
      "Optional Icing (affiliate link): The icing is optional. Feel free to skip it completely and leave the cake plain. Or you can dust the warm cake with confectioners\u2019 sugar using a\u00a0fine mesh sieve."

    "instructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Spray a 9\u00d75 inch loaf pan with nonstick spray.",
      "Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. In a medium bowl, whisk the melted and slightly cooled butter, egg, granulated sugar, sour cream, milk, and vanilla together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, then whisk to completely combine. Avoid over-mixing. Fold in the sprinkles.",
      "Pour the batter into prepared loaf pan.\u00a0Bake loaf cake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, covering loosely with foil about halfway through to prevent the top from over-browning. Poke the center of the cake with a toothpick. If it comes out clean, the cake is done. Oven times will vary between ovens. My cake usually takes 55 minutes. Cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack.",
      "Slice cake into layers: The video tutorial above is a helpful visual for the next few steps. Carefully remove cooled cake from loaf pan. (You will use the loaf pan again in the next step.) Place on a cutting board and using a very sharp or serrated knife, slowly slice horizontally into 3 even layers. As shown in the video above, I usually stand the loaf upright on one end and cut it down vertically. Feel free to use a ruler for precision. A cake leveler isn\u2019t very helpful because this is a denser cake.",
      "Remove ice cream from freezer. Let it soften for 15 minutes or microwave it for about 20-30 seconds.",
      "Assemble & freeze cake: Line loaf pan with parchment paper or plastic wrap with enough overhang on the sides to lift the ice cream loaf cake out of the pan after freezing. Place bottom loaf cake layer into lined pan. Slowly and carefully spread 1 pint of softened ice cream in an even layer on top. Top with center loaf cake layer. Slowly and carefully spread 2nd pint of ice cream evenly on top. Place top loaf cake layer on top, pressing it down gently so it really sticks to the ice cream beneath it. Cover assembled loaf cake with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and freeze for at least 8 hours and up to 3 days. (If freezing for longer than 1 day, let it sit for 10 minutes at room temperature before pouring ganache on top in step 9.)",
      "With about 15 minutes left in freezing time, make the ganache topping: Place chopped chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to gently simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil\u2013 that\u2019s too hot!) Pour over chocolate, then let it sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften the chocolate. With a metal spoon or small rubber spatula, very slowly stir until completely combined and chocolate has melted. The finer you chopped the chocolate, the quicker it will melt with the cream. Set aside for 10 minutes to thicken as you complete the next step.",
      "Remove loaf cake from the freezer and using the parchment overhang on the sides, carefully lift it out of the loaf pan. Parchment may tear, but do your best to remove the whole cake. Use a knife to loosen it from the pan if needed. Remove parchment from cake and place cake on a cutting board.",
      "Pour and spread ganache on top. Garnish with sprinkles if desired. Ganache will set quickly since the loaf is so cold. Let the cake sit for 3-5 minutes to slightly soften before slicing. (Slicing will be VERY hard to do otherwise!)",
      "Using a very sharp or serrated knife, cut into slices about 3/4 inch thick. Cake will be hard since it\u2019s frozen, but softens as the minutes go by. I like it better when the cake and ice cream are a little softer after a few minutes.",
      "Cover and store leftover cake/slices in the freezer for up to 1 week."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: You can make this ice cream cake ahead of time since it needs to freeze. Freeze assembled cake for up to 3 days. See end of step 6. It\u2019s best to add ganache topping soon before slicing and serving. If absolutely needed, you can top with ganache then carefully cover and place back into the freezer for up to 8 hours. Let it sit at room temperature for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.",

      "Cake Flour: Sometimes a cake flour substitute works in recipes calling for cake flour, but it\u2019s best to use real cake flour here. The cake tastes a bit dense if using the substitute. You can find cake flour in most grocery stores in the baking aisle.",
      "Sour Cream\u00a0&\u00a0Milk:\u00a0Full fat sour cream and whole milk are strongly recommended for the best taste and texture. A full fat plain yogurt would work instead of the sour cream, though the cake may not taste as tender. Same goes with a lower fat or nondairy milk.",
      "Sprinkles: Feel free to leave out the sprinkles if desired. For the best sprinkles to use in cakes, see details above the recipe.",
      "Ice Cream: You can use any flavor ice cream, but I recommend avoiding ice cream with large chunks in it. Slicing the cake will be very difficult (almost impossible!) if you have to slice through large chunks in the ice cream. I used chocolate chip ice cream, which has thin and small pieces of chocolate throughout."

      "Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Generously grease a 9\u00d713-inch cake pan.",
      "Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed for 2 minutes until creamed together. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the egg whites. Beat on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Mixture will appear curdled and that\u2019s ok. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients just until incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk until combined. Do not overmix. Whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl, then fold in the chopped Oreo pieces. Avoid over-mixing.",
      "Pour batter into prepared cake pan. Bake for around 32\u201335 minutes or until the cake is baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cake to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack. The cake must be completely cool before frosting.",
      "In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium-high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed until creamy. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar and vanilla extract, and then beat on medium speed until combined and completely smooth, about 2 full minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl. Switch the mixer to low speed and with the mixer running, carefully pour in the cream in a slow and steady stream. After all of the cream has been added, turn the mixer up to high speed and beat until thick and stiff peaks form, about 1\u20132 minutes.",
      "Frost the cake: If you\u2019d like to pipe any frosting on the cake like I did in the photo above, set aside about 1 cup of frosting. Fold chopped Oreos into remaining frosting (or all of the frosting if you are not piping any of it). Spread onto cooled cake\u2014it will be a thick layer of frosting. I find a small offset spatula is best for frosting 9\u00d713-inch sheet cakes. For the pictured piping, I used a Wilton 1M piping tip and piped a zigzag design around the border.",
      "Serve immediately or cover and set aside for a few hours before serving. Or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day, then bring to room temperature before serving. You can definitely serve the cake cold, but many preferred it closer to room temperature. Frosting is sturdy enough at room temperature or in warmer weather for a few hours.",
      "Cover leftover cake\u00a0tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: The cake can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. The frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Assemble and frost the cake the next day when you are ready to serve. Frosted cake can be frozen up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving. Here\u2019s my how to freeze cakes page.",

      "Whole Milk & Sour Cream/Room Temperature Ingredients: Whole milk and sour cream are strongly recommended for the best taste and texture. A full-fat plain yogurt would work instead of the sour cream, but the cake may not taste as light. Same goes with a lower-fat milk. All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly. Read here for more\u00a0information.",
      "Layer Cake: Grease 3 8-inch or 2 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. Divide the batter between the pans. Bake at 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) for around 24\u201326 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, the cakes are done. The frosting yields enough for filling and frosting a 2 -or 3-layer cake.",
      "Cupcakes: My vanilla cupcakes recipe is essentially this same recipe, only halved, so I recommend using that. Fold in about 3/4 cup of chopped Oreo pieces before spooning/pouring batter into liners. Halve the frosting recipe above. For close to 3 dozen cupcakes, follow the the cookies & cream cake batter recipe above and the baking instructions for cupcakes. Use the frosting recipe as written above.",
      "Amount of Cake Batter & Frosting: If it\u2019s helpful for using different size cake pan sizes and conversions, this recipe yields about 7 cups of cake batter and 4\u20135 cups of frosting."

      "Preliminary Note: This cake is swirled and topped with chocolate ganache. If you aren\u2019t topping the cake with ganache, halve the ganache recipe so you\u2019re only making what you need for the swirl. (Use one 4 ounce chocolate bar and 1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream.)",
      "Make the ganache:\u00a0Place chopped chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to gently simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil\u2013 that\u2019s too hot!) Pour over chocolate, then let it sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften the chocolate. Very slowly stir until completely combined and chocolate has melted. The finer you chopped the chocolate, the quicker it will melt with the cream. You should have about 1 and 1/2 cups of ganache. Set half aside (3/4 cup or 180ml) at room temperature uncovered until it has thickened into a gravy-like consistency, about 30 minutes. Use this in step 7. Cover and refrigerate the rest of the ganache to use as the topping in step 10. Ganache topping can be refrigerated for up to 5 days before using.",
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) and generously grease a 10-inch Bundt pan. To guarantee the Bundt cake releases seamlessly, I strongly recommend using a heavy coating of nonstick spray. Our favorite pans include this one and this one.",
      "Make\u00a0the cake: Mash the bananas until there\u2019s hardly any lumps. I usually just use my mixer for this! Set mashed bananas aside.",
      "Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add both sugars and beat on high speed for 2 minutes until creamed together. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the eggs and the vanilla. Beat on medium-high speed until combined, then beat in the mashed bananas. Mixture will be chunky and appear curdled\u2013 that\u2019s ok. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk and mixing each addition just until incorporated. Do not over-mix. The batter will be thick with some lumps. Makes about 6 cups of batter.",
      "You will use the slightly thickened ganache reserved for the swirl in this step. Pour about 1/3 of the cake batter (about 2 cups) evenly into prepared pan. Drizzle half of the ganache on top (about 6 Tablespoons). Swirl with a knife or toothpick. Evenly pour another 1/3 of the cake batter on top, followed by the rest of the ganache (about 6 Tablespoons), then the rest of the cake batter. Swirl everything together with a knife or toothpick. See photo above for a visual.",
      "Bake for 60-75 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean with just a couple lightly moist crumbs. This is a large, heavy cake so don\u2019t be alarmed if it takes a little longer in your oven. If the cake is browning quickly in the oven, tent it with aluminum foil to help it bake more evenly.",
      "Once done, remove from the oven and allow to cool for 2 hours inside the pan. Then, invert the slightly cooled cake onto a wire rack or serving dish. Cool completely before topping, slicing, and serving.",
      "The ganache topping will be very thick by now. Warm it over low heat on the stove stirring constantly until thinned and drizzle-able consistency. Do not over-heat it. Or warm in 10 second increments in the microwave, stirring after each until thinned. Drizzle over cake, then slice and serve.",
      "Cover leftover cake tightly and store at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Cake tastes unbelievable warmed in the microwave for a few seconds and served with vanilla ice cream."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: You can prepare the ganache used for the swirl and topping up to 5 days in advance. Make sure both are warmed/thinned out before using. The ganache used for the swirl should be a gravy-like consistency and the topping can be pretty thin. To warm/thin out, see step 10 above or step 5 in the chocolate ganache post. Cake with or without topping freezes well up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature before serving.",

      "Chocolate: You can use high quality chocolate chips if needed (I prefer Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips), but I recommend using real chocolate baking bars. You can find them right next to the chocolate chips in the baking aisle. They are sold in 4 ounce bars. I like Bakers or Ghirardelli brands. You can use other varieties of chocolate too, such as milk chocolate (aka German Chocolate) or Dark Chocolate. Do not use white chocolate.",
      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk is required for this recipe. You can make your own DIY version of buttermilk if needed. Add 1 Tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough room temperature whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1 and 1/3 cups. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe."

A 9-inch round cake pan is a little too small. A 9-inch square baking pan could work, but the buckle will be thin and thus require a shorter bake time.",

If skipping the almond extract, I recommend adding about 1 teaspoon of lemon zest for some extra flavor. And if you\u2019d like to top with another nut, chopped pecans or walnuts are excellent here.",
      "Cherries: I use and recommend fresh dark sweet cherries in this recipe. Pit them, then slice in half or quarters. You could easily use rainier or sour cherries with no changes to the recipe. You can use frozen cherries if needed, but make sure they are halved or quartered. Do not thaw. If using canned cherries, drain all liquid and chop in half before using. Do not use cherries canned in heavy syrup and do not use cherry pie filling because both are already sweetened. If you\u2019d like to substitute the cherries, we\u2019ve tested this with the same amount of blueberries (fresh or frozen\u2014do not thaw) and they work wonderfully. For extra flavor, feel free to add 1 teaspoon lemon zest when you add the vanilla extract."

      "Chocolate Chips: 1 standard 12 ounce bag is enough for this recipe. You can use regular size chocolate chips in both the cake and topping.

    "instructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease three 8-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)",
      "Make the cake:\u00a0Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside. (Note that the video shows sifting the flour, but you do not have to.)",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Beat in the egg whites until combined, then add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and coconut extract. Beat until combined. Mixture will look curdled as a result of the varying textures and solid butter combining. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients, coconut milk, and pineapple juice. Beat on low speed until combined, then beat in the shredded coconut and pineapple chunks just until combined. Whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no butter lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.",
      "Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 22-24 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it\u2019s done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. (Make the curd as the cakes cool.) The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Make the pineapple curd:\u00a0Fill the bottom pot of a double boiler with 1-2 inches of water. (Or use the DIY double boiler method listed in the notes.) Place on high heat. Once the water begins to boil, reduce to low heat to keep the water at a simmer. Whisk the egg, egg yolks, granulated sugar, cornstarch, pineapple juice, and salt together the top pot of your double boiler. Continue to whisk as the curd cooks because constant whisking prevents the egg yolks from curdling. Whisk and cook until the mixture becomes slightly thick, resembling the texture of hollandaise sauce, about 10 minutes. If curd isn\u2019t thickening, turn up the heat and keep whisking. Remove pan from heat. Whisk in the butter. The butter will melt from the heat of the curd. Pour curd into a jar or bowl and place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top so it is touching the top of the curd. (This prevents a skin from forming on top.) Cool completely. The curd will continue to thicken as it cools. Once cool, the plastic wrap can be removed. Makes 1 cup. You will have leftover curd after using in the cake. Cover and refrigerate leftovers for up to 1 week. (Great on sourdough, biscuits, or toast!)",
      "Make the frosting:\u00a0In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium speed until creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, coconut milk or pineapple juice, vanilla extract, and salt with the mixer running on low. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. If you want the frosting a little thicker, add the extra 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar (I usually add it).",
      "Assemble and decorate: If your cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. I use and recommend an icing spatula to apply the frosting & curd. Evenly spread a scant 1/2 cup of frosting on top. Spread 1/4 cup of pineapple curd on top of the frosting. Top with 2nd cake layer and evenly cover the top with 1/2 cup of frosting, then 1/4 cup of curd. Carefully place the third cake layer on top. The cake is very slippery due to the frosting and curd, so be careful with it. I highly recommend a crumb coat for this cake, so spread a very very thin layer of frosting on top and all around the exterior of the cake. A\u00a0bench scraper is helpful to smooth the sides. Refrigerate crumb-coated cake for 30-60 minutes\u2014again, this is a slippery cake so refrigeration is very helpful. Remove cake from the refrigerator and spread the remaining frosting all over the cake. (Which should only be a small amount at this point.) Decorate with pineapple chunks on top of the cake and/or press coconut gently into the sides of the cake.",
      "Refrigerate cake for at least 20 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting, though it\u2019s still a pretty fluffy cake.",
      "Cover leftover cake\u00a0tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: You can make the pineapple curd ahead of time. After it cools completely, cover tightly and refrigerate for up to 1 week. The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. When ready to decorate, let the frosting sit at room temperature to slightly soften for 15 minutes, then give it one more mix with the mixer on medium speed for about 1 minute before frosting cake. Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving.",

      "Cake Flour:\u00a0For the best results, I strongly recommend cake flour. You can find cake flour in the baking aisle and I have many more recipes using it. If you\u2019re in a pinch, you can use a DIY cake flour substitute but the cake won\u2019t taste as light and soft.",
      "Egg Whites: Egg whites (no yolks) are KEY to the cake\u2019s fluffy texture. Save 2 egg yolks for the pineapple curd.",
      "Canned Coconut Milk: With some reviews that this cake is too wet, we have re-tested and changed the amount of coconut milk to 3/4 cup (180ml) instead of the original 1 cup (240ml). Canned coconut milk is a cooking ingredient, not a beverage. It is usually unsweetened, so make sure you\u2019re using unsweetened. It\u2019s usually found near the Thai food products. Do not use refrigerated carton coconut milk. You need 3/4 cup for the cake, not the entire can. You can use 2 more Tablespoons in the frosting if desired. There will be a little leftover in the can. Coconut milk separates, so make sure you either shake up the can before opening or, after opening the can, whisk the liquid and coconut cream together to yield the thick coconut milk you need in this recipe.",
      "Sweetened Shredded Coconut:\u00a0I recommend using sweetened shredded coconut. It\u2019s moister than unsweetened coconut and that makes a big difference in the cake\u2019s texture. If desired, pulse the coconut shreds in a food processor or chop them up so they aren\u2019t as long inside and outside of the cake. Chopping the coconut is optional.",
      "Pineapple Chunks: If using canned pineapple chunks, purchase a can labeled with \u201cchunks\u201d or \u201ctidbits.\u201d You can save the liquid you drain to use in the cake. (There likely won\u2019t be enough for the curd though.) Do not use crushed pineapple, which is too liquid and thin. If using fresh pineapple, cut chunks into bite-size pieces.",
      "Double Boiler Alternative for Curd: If you do not own a double boiler, you can simply place a small heatproof glass bowl over a saucepan\u2014you will cook the curd in the top pot/bowl.",
      "Pineapple Juice:\u00a0You can use fresh or canned pineapple juice in the cake batter and frosting recipes. However, in order for the pineapple curd to thicken, you must use canned juice in the curd. See blog post above for details. Since you need canned juice for the curd, it may just be easiest to use canned juice in the batter and frosting, too.",
      "Cream Cheese: Use brick cream cheese, not cream cheese spread. If desired, you can use this vanilla buttercream instead of cream cheese frosting. If you follow that frosting recipe, you can use canned coconut milk instead of the whole milk/heavy cream OR 3 Tablespoons pineapple juice and 2 Tablespoons coconut milk instead of whole milk/heavy cream.",
      "Amount of Cake Batter: This recipe yields nearly 8 cups of batter, which is helpful if you need it for different Cake Pan Sizes & Conversions. See box above the recipe for different cake pan options."

      "Make the chocolate ganache as the cake cools because the ganache must cool too: Place chopped chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it begins to gently simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil\u2014that\u2019s too hot!) Pour over chocolate, then let it sit for 2\u20133 minutes to gently soften the chocolate. With a metal spoon or small rubber spatula, very slowly stir until completely combined and chocolate has melted. Ganache will be thin, so let it cool and thicken for at least 30\u201360 minutes before using. Refrigerating speeds this up, but the ganache will not cool evenly. Stir it a few times as it sets in the refrigerator so it remains smooth. You can also let the ganache fully cool and thicken (takes about 2 hours). After 2 hours, you can whip the cooled ganache with a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until light in color and texture, about 3\u20134 minutes on medium-high speed.

      "Amount of Sugar: I tested this recipe with 6 Tablespoons of sugar and the cake wasn\u2019t as sweet, of course, but it tasted pretty plain. I recommend sticking with 8 Tbsp (1/2 cup). Topping with chocolate ganache definitely balances out the sweetness.",
      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk is required for this recipe. You can make your own DIY version of buttermilk if needed. Add 1/2 teaspoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1/4 cup. (In a pinch, lower-fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.)

Fill each 2/3 full to avoid spilling over the sides or sinking. Bake for 20\u201322 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Don\u2019t over-bake, which will dry out the cupcakes. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before frosting.",
      "Chocolate in Ganache: Ganache will only set if the correct chocolate is used. You can use high-quality chocolate chips if needed (I prefer Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips), but I recommend using pure chocolate baking bars. You can find them right next to the chocolate chips in the baking aisle. They are sold in 4-ounce (113g) bars. I like Bakers or Ghirardelli brands. You can use other varieties of chocolate too, such as milk chocolate (aka German chocolate), bittersweet, or dark chocolate. If using white chocolate, reduce the cream to 1/3 cup (80ml). White chocolate is softer, so you need less cream.",

I don\u2019t recommend doubling this recipe to make a 2-layer cake because it will be quite thick and taste heavy. Instead, divide the batter between 2 6-inch cake pans (bake time would be shorter) or divide the batter from these chocolate cupcakes in 2 6-inch cake pans. Start checking with a toothpick at 26 minutes."

      "Make the sugared cranberries and rosemary: If you want to decorate the cake with sugared cranberries and rosemary, start them the night before because they need to sit for several hours.\u00a0 Place cranberries and rosemary in a large heatproof bowl. Set aside. In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, bring the water and 3/4 cup (150g) of sugar to a simmer, whisking until the sugar has dissolved. Remove the pan from heat and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Pour the sugar syrup over the cranberries and rosemary and stir. Cover the bowl and set aside for 15 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cranberries and rosemary from the sugar syrup and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Allow to dry, uncovered, for 1 hour. Pour remaining 1/2 cup (100g) sugar into a large bowl. Toss the cranberries and rosemary in the sugar, coating them all the way around. Place on a parchment paper\u2014or silicone baking mat-lined baking sheet and let them dry uncovered for at least 1 hour at room temperature or in the refrigerator. Cover tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. For more uses, see how to make sugared cranberries.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Spray\u00a0a\u00a012\u00d717-inch baking pan with nonstick spray or grease with butter, so the parchment paper sticks. Then line it with parchment paper so the cake seamlessly releases. Spray or grease the parchment paper too. We want an extremely nonstick surface for this cake roll.",
      "Make the cake: Whisk the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside until the next step. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat the egg whites and 1/2 cup (100g) sugar together on high speed for 4-5 minutes or until stiff peaks form. Transfer to another bowl. Using the same mixing bowl you just had the egg whites in (no need to clean it), add the egg yolks, remaining sugar, oil, and vanilla extract. Beat together on high speed for 3-4 minutes or until thickened and light in color.",
      "Add half of the whipped egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Beat on low speed for 10 seconds. Repeat with remaining egg whites and beat on low for 10 seconds. Add half of the flour mixture and beat on low or fold with a silicone spatula until combined. Repeat with remaining flour mixture. Avoid over-mixing and deflating those egg whites. Batter will be very light.",
      "Spread batter evenly into prepared pan. Gently bang the pan on the counter a couple times to pop any air bubbles. Bake for 15-16 minutes or until the cake springs back when lightly poked with your finger. Cake will look a little bubbly on top when it\u2019s done. That\u2019s ok. Avoid over-baking cake because it will crack if over-baked. As the cake bakes, get started on the next step.",
      "Prepare to roll: As the cake bakes, place a piece of parchment paper (larger than the cake) or a thin kitchen/tea towel flat on the counter. (Note: I find a kitchen towel is better to help prevent cracking.) Using a fine mesh sieve, dust parchment/towel with 3 Tablespoons (15g) of cocoa powder. Once the cake comes out of the oven, quickly run a knife around the edges to loosen it. Immediately invert it onto the parchment/towel. Peel off the parchment paper that was on the bottom of the cake as it baked. Starting with the narrow end, begin tightly rolling the hot cake up with the parchment/towel. Do this slowly and gently. The cake will be warm. Allow the cake to cool completely rolled up in the parchment/towel. Feel free to place it in the refrigerator to speed it up, about 3 hours and up to 1 day.",
      "During this time, make the meringue mushrooms: Preheat oven to 200\u00b0F (93\u00b0C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. In a completely clean residue-free large glass or metal mixing bowl, using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg white, cream of tartar, and salt together on high speed until foamy, about 2 minutes\u2014this is a small amount and the whisk on a stand mixer might not reach it, so whisk by hand until foamy if needed. With the mixer running on high speed, slowly add the sugar and beat until stiff glossy peaks form, about 2 more minutes. Snip off the end of a plastic bag or fit a round piping tip in a piping bag. I use and recommend Wilton 2A piping tip or any tip with around a 1/2 inch opening. Pipe quarter-sized circles (these will be the round mushroom tops) and 1-inch tall cones (these will be the stems). You will have enough meringue batter for about 16 mushrooms. I usually only make 8-12 and discard leftovers, but feel free to make all 16. Using a moistened finger (just a dab of water is fine), smooth down any peaks. If desired, lightly dust mushroom tops with cocoa powder using a fine mesh sieve. Bake for 2 hours. Do not open the oven as the meringues bake. Turn off the oven after 2 hours and let the meringues sit inside the cooling oven for 20 minutes. Remove meringues from the oven and cool completely. When they\u2019re just about cool, melt the 1 ounce of chocolate in a double boiler or use the microwave. If using the microwave, melt in 15 second increments, stopping and stirring between each until melted and smooth. Cool for 5-10 minutes. (Easier to adhere mushrooms if the melted chocolate is a bit cool.) Once meringues have cooled, use a flat spatula to remove them from the baking sheets. Dot a bit of chocolate onto the center of the bottom of a mushroom top. Adhere a mushroom stem to it. Place back on the baking sheet to set. If stems or tops still have a little peak, scrape off with a knife or your spatula, as you see me do in the video above. Leaning them against the rim is helpful if they keep toppling over. Repeat with remaining tops and stems to form mushrooms. Let chocolate cool and harden, about 1 hour.",
      "Remove the cake roll from the refrigerator and allow to sit on the counter for a few minutes to warm up as you prepare the whipped cream.",
      "Make the whipped cream: Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, Frangelico, confectioners\u2019 sugar, and cocoa powder on medium-high speed until medium to stiff peaks form, about 2-3 minutes.",
      "Gently and very slowly unroll the cake. Spread whipped cream evenly on top, leaving about a 1/2 inch border around the cake. I like using a large or\u00a0small offset spatula to spread. Sprinkle chopped hazelnuts on top. Gently roll the cake back up, without the parchment/towel this time. Roll it slowly. This part is messy. Carefully place on a cutting board. If the exterior of the cake looks moist, dust with a little cocoa powder. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 days before shaping and topping with ganache.",
      "Make the ganache topping: Place chopped chocolate in a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until it begins to simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil\u2014that\u2019s too hot.) Pour over chocolate, then let it sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften the chocolate. Slowly stir until completely combined and chocolate has melted. Ganache will be thin, so it has to thicken before using. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour to thicken.",
      "Remove rolled cake from the refrigerator. Diagonally slice a 3-4 inch section off one end. At this point, I usually place the cake on a serving platter. Place the angled side against a side of the roll, forming a branch. Slowly pour and spread thickened ganache all over the top and sides of cake. Feel free to leave the cut ends exposed (as you see in these photos) or spread ganache over the ends\u2014there should be plenty of ganache to use. Use a fork to make textured lines resembling tree bark. Feel free to wipe the serving plate if ganache dripped all over.",
      "Decorate with meringue mushrooms, sugared cranberries and rosemary, and a dusting of confectioners\u2019 sugar just before serving.",
      "Cover leftover cake and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: You can get started on the sugared cranberries and rosemary ahead of time. See step 1. You can make the meringue mushrooms in advance (step 7) as long as the weather is dry. (Humidity will ruin them.) Store at room temperature for up to 2-3 days before using. You can make the roll cake in advance (steps 2-6) because it must cool/chill completely before filling. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 1 day. You can also refrigerate the filled cake roll (steps 9-10) for up to 2 days. You can make the whipped cream (step 9) 1 day in advance too. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. You can make the chocolate ganache topping (step 11) 1 day in advance, but if you let it sit for longer than 1 hour, it will thicken too much. If refrigerating for longer than 1 hour, cover it. To thin it out when ready to use, stir and warm it in a heat-proof bowl over a pan of simmering water for about 1 minute. Do not microwave it. Entire cake can be made 1-2 days in advance too. (Steps 1-12.) Cover and refrigerate until ready to decorate and serve. You can also freeze the assembled cake before or after adding the ganache. (Steps 1-11 or 12.) Cover and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before continuing with the recipe. It\u2019s best to decorate with sugared cranberries, meringues, and a dusting of confectioners\u2019 sugar (step 13) closest to serving.",

      "Chocolate: You need 6 ounces of pure chocolate for the ganache topping and 1 ounce for the mushrooms.

You can use semi-sweet or bittersweet. If using white chocolate, reduce the amount of heavy cream in the ganache to 1/2 cup (120ml)."

The thinner the crepe, the better the texture. Cook for 1-2 minutes, then flip as soon as the bottom is set. Don\u2019t wait too long to flip crepes or else they will taste rubbery. Cook the other side for 30 seconds until set. Transfer the cooked crepe to a large plate and repeat with the remaining batter, making sure to butter the pan between each crepe. If desired, separate each crepe with parchment paper so they do not stick together. Though, if using enough butter in your pan, the crepes won\u2019t stick. Yields about 28 crepes.",
      "Loosely cover and set your crepes aside at room temperature as you prepare the tiramisu filling. You can also tightly cover and refrigerate the crepes for up to 1 day. Crepes must be room temperature or cold before you begin assembling the cake.",
      "Make the tiramisu filling: First part of the tiramisu filling is to prepare concentrated espresso flavoring. Using a fork, mix the espresso powder and warm water together in a very small bowl. Set aside to cool down for a few minutes. You will mix it with the mascarpone. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream and rum (if using) together on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3-4 minutes. Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and stiff peaks. Set whipped cream aside. With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the mascarpone, confectioners\u2019 sugar, vanilla extract, and cooled espresso liquid together on medium speed in a large bowl until combined and smooth, about 2 minutes. Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture. Don\u2019t worry if it looks curdled\u2014mine sometimes does\u2014it doesn\u2019t taste that way and will smooth out when it\u2019s stacked in the cake. Use filling immediately or cover and chill in the refrigerator for up to 1 day. Yields about 4 cups filling.",
      "Assemble the cake: Spread 1-2 teaspoons of filling on the center of your cake stand or cake serving plate. This helps adhere the cake to the plate. Place a crepe on top. Spread about 2 heaping Tablespoons of filling evenly on top. If desired, dust with cocoa powder. Repeat layering crepes, filling, and a dusting of cocoa powder. Top with final and last crepe.",
      "Whipped Cream Topping: You can frost the cake with whipped cream before or after chilling the cake in the refrigerator in step 9. My advice\u2013 I find it tastes better and slices easier if you chill the cake WITH the whipped cream on top. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, rum (if using), and confectioners\u2019 sugar together on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3-4 minutes. Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and stiff peaks and are the perfect consistency for spreading or piping. Spread or pipe whipped cream on top of the cake. If you have extra, feel free to spread all around the sides of the cake too. If desired, dust with cocoa powder.",
      "Refrigerate the cake for at least 3 hours and up to 1 day before serving. Chilling the cake in the refrigerator is imperative because the cake won\u2019t slice otherwise. No need to cover the cake if you\u2019re chilling it for only 3 hours. If chilling longer than that, I recommend loosely covering the cake.",
      "Cover leftover cake and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days."

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Crepe batter, cooked crepes, filling, and assembled cake can all be prepared in advance. See the end of step 3, step 5, the end of step 6, and step 9. To freeze, prepare cake through step 8, but do not dust with cocoa powder on top. Tightly cover and freeze for up to 3 months. Remove from the freezer, evenly dust the top with cocoa, then thaw in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. (Can thaw covered or uncovered.)",

      "Milk:\u00a0I prefer whole milk in the crepe batter. For a richer tasting crepe, half-and-half or heavy cream work too. 2% is OK, but I wouldn\u2019t use lower fat milks. Any low fat or full fat nondairy milk works too.",
      "Espresso Powder: You need very strong espresso for the filling. Here we are making it using espresso powder and water. If you can\u2019t find espresso powder, use instant coffee powder instead. You can also use 1 Tablespoon of super super super strong room temperature or cold black coffee instead of the espresso powder/water.",
      "Alcohol: The filling and whipped cream topping include alcohol. I recommend rum or Grand Marnier. Skip the alcohol for a non-alcoholic version. No need to replace it with anything.",
      "Cocoa Powder: Dusting cocoa powder between each layer, as well as on top of the crepe cake, is optional. If using, you can use natural or dutch-process cocoa."

    "instructions": [
      "Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease three 8-inch or 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.) I recommend using nonstick spray for greasing. I also recommend 8 inch cake pans as the 9 inch cakes will be pretty thin.",
      "Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed for 2 minutes until creamed together. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the egg whites. Beat on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk until combined. Do not overmix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.",
      "Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 22-24 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before assembling.",
      "Make the whipped cream: Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, confectioners\u2019 sugar, vanilla extract, and almond extract on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3-4 minutes. Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and stiff peaks and are the perfect consistency for decorating cakes. Use immediately or cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours. Yields about 4 cups.",
      "Assemble cake: If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called \u201cleveling\u201d the cakes. (Discard thin layer or crumble over ice cream.) Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Evenly spread 1 heaping cup of whipped cream on top. I always use an icing spatula to spread. Arrange a single layer of mixed berries on top. Top with 2nd cake layer. Spread another 1 heaping cup of whipped cream on top, then a single layer of berries. Top with 3rd cake layer. Spread remaining whipped cream on top and garnish with fresh berries. Add a dusting of confectioners\u2019 sugar on the berries, if desired, and/or garnish with fresh florals.",
      "Chill the assembled cake, uncovered, for at least 2 hours and up to 1 day before slicing and serving. This time in the refrigerator helps the whipped cream thicken and makes cutting neater and easier. If chilling for longer than a few hours, you can carefully cover it with plastic wrap or use a cake carrier for storing in the refrigerator (what I always store my cakes in!). *Note that the berries could begin to release their juices if kept in the refrigerator for longer than 2 hours. For cutting, I recommend using your sharpest knife and cutting slowly.",
      "Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Prepare cake through step 4. Wrap the individual baked and cooled cake layers tightly and keep at room temperature for 1 day or freeze up to 3 months. Bring to room temperature (if frozen) then continue with step 5. See How to Freeze Cakes if desired. Whipped cream can also be made 1 day ahead of time. Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight. If it\u2019s too stiff after refrigerating, stir in 1 extra Tablespoon of heavy cream or even milk to help thin out. I don\u2019t recommend freezing the assembled cake as the whipped cream and berries won\u2019t thaw very nicely. However, you can wrap and freeze leftover individual slices for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature before enjoying.",

      "Leftover Egg Yolks: Make some lemon curd! You can add thin layers of it between the cake layers on top of the whipped cream and under the berries. Here are other recipes where you can use leftover egg yolks.",
      "Whole milk and sour cream are strongly recommended for the best taste and texture. A full fat plain yogurt would work instead, though the cake may not be as light. Same goes with a lower fat milk.",
      "Other Flavor Cakes: See above for alternative flavor ideas. Each cake listed yields a 3 layer 9-inch cake. If you want a 3 layer 8 inch cake instead, add about 2 minutes of bake time to its recipe. If using chocolate cake, see those recipe notes about turning into a 3 layer cake.",
      "2 Layer Cake: I highly recommend sticking to a 3 layer cake for this look. A 2 layer cake would be pretty short. If desired, though, use this white cake recipe (which is 2 layers) or turn any 3 layer cakes listed above into a 2 layer 9-inch cakes by extending the bake time. Use a toothpick to test for doneness. Halving the whipped cream should leave you with plenty for a 2 layer cake. Use a heaping 1 cup of fresh berries.",
      "6 Inch Cake: You can use this exact decorating technique on a smaller 6 inch cake. I have plenty of 6 inch cake flavor ideas in my 6 Inch Cake recipes post. Halve the ingredients in the whipped cream recipe and use only about 1 cup of berries."

      "Pour/spoon batter evenly into cake pans.",
      "Bake: Bake for around 27-31 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. After about 18 minutes, tent the cakes with aluminum foil to prevent the tops and sides from over-browning. To test the cakes for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it\u2019s done.

Taste the frosting before adding the 1/8 teaspoon of salt, then add a pinch if desired. It\u2019s imperative to use room temperature butter in order to properly cream with the sugar and be the proper base for the buttercream.",
      "Eggs: You need 4 egg yolks and 2 egg whites in this cake batter. It\u2019s easiest to separate eggs when they\u2019re cold. The eggs must be at room temperature to whip properly, so after you separate the eggs, cover the 4 yolks and 2 whites and set aside for at least 20 minutes before starting.",

      "Prepare topping first:\u00a0Pour 1/4 cup melted butter into an ungreased 9\u00d72 inch pie dish or round cake pan. (Make sure the pan is 2 inches deep. I recommend this pie dish, which is 1.8 inches deep but I never have an overflow issue.) Sprinkle brown sugar evenly over butter. Blot any excess liquid off the fruit with a clean towel or paper towel. (The wetter the fruit, the more likely the cake could overflow or the topping could seep over the sides when inverted.) Arrange about 6-7 blotted pineapple slices and all the cherries on top of the brown sugar. I like to halve 3 pineapple rings and arrange them around the sides of the pan, too. See my photo and video above for a visual of the arranged topping. Place pan in the refrigerator for a few minutes as you prepare the cake batter. This helps solidify or \u201cset\u201d the topping\u2019s arrangement.",

      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed until creamed together, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. On high speed, beat in the egg whites until combined, then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer onto low speed and as the mixer runs, slowly pour in the pineapple juice and milk. Beat on low speed just until all of the ingredients are combined. Do not over-mix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.",
      "Remove topping from the refrigerator. Pour and spread cake batter evenly over topping.",
      "Bake for 43-48 minutes, tenting foil on top of the cake halfway through bake time to prevent the top from over-browning before the center has a chance to fully cook. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out mostly clean\u2014a couple moist crumbs are OK.

Some of the juices from the topping will seep over the sides\u2014that\u2019s ok. You can slice and serve the cake warm, but the slices will be messy. I find it\u2019s best to cool the cake completely at room temperature before slicing and serving. Do not refrigerate the cake to speed up the cooling process because it could end up tasting overly dense.",
      "Cover leftover slices and store for up to 3 days in the refrigerator or 3 months in the freezer. Thaw at room temperature. I don\u2019t recommend freezing the cake as a whole because the topping arrangement doesn\u2019t thaw very nicely. See make ahead instructions below."

      "Make Ahead Instructions: You can refrigerate the topping in step 2 for up to 1 day. If refrigerating for longer than 1 hour, cover it tightly. Other than that, this isn\u2019t the best cake to make ahead of time or freeze because the pineapples will settle down into the cake\u2014while still tasty, the presentation won\u2019t be as pleasing. You can, however, prepare the wet ingredients (cover and refrigerate) and dry ingredients (cover at room temperature) separately up to 1 day ahead of time, then continue with the recipe the next day. Let the wet ingredients come to room temperature before mixing.",

      "Old Recipe: The current cake batter recipe was updated in 2020. If you loved the old cake batter recipe, originally published in 2014, here it is: The topping recipe is the same. Prepare the recipe above through step 2. For the cake batter, whisk 1 and 2/3 cups (210g) all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together. In a separate bowl, whisk 1/2 cup (115g) melted unsalted butter, 3/4 cup (150g) packed light brown sugar, 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar, 1 large egg, 1/4 cup (60g) yogurt or sour cream, 1/2 cup (120ml) milk, 1/4 cup (60ml) pineapple juice, and 1 Tablespoon vanilla extract together. Whisk wet and dry ingredients together until smooth. Continue with step 5 in the recipe above.",
      "Pineapple & Cherries: Traditional recipes use canned pineapple and maraschino cherries. I recommend 1 20 ounce can of pineapple rings/slices, which usually holds 10 rings/slices. You can use fresh pineapple rings/slices and fresh cherries if desired. If using fresh cherries, I recommend halving them. Blot excess liquid off the fresh fruit just as I instruct in step 2. Fresh or canned pineapple chunks, tidbits, and/or crushed pineapple will create a messy topping that could spill over the sides when the cake is inverted. I recommend rings/slices because they are larger.",
      "Sour Cream & Milk: Full fat sour cream and whole milk are strongly recommended for the best taste and texture. A full fat plain yogurt would work instead of the sour cream, though the cake may not taste as tender. Same goes with a lower fat or nondairy milk.",
      "Why is everything at room temperature? All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly. Read more about why room temperature ingredients are important."

      "2 Tablespoons (30ml) milk or heavy cream",
      "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast together. Set aside. Heat the milk and butter together in the microwave until the butter is melted and the mixture is warm to the touch, between 100-110\u00b0F, 38-43\u00b0C. Pour the warm milk mixture into the dry ingredients. Add the egg. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment, or using a rubber spatula and mixing by hand, beat/mix the mixture until a soft dough forms. The dough is ready when it gently pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If the dough is pretty sticky, beat/mix in 2-4 extra Tablespoons of flour. (Keep in mind that you want the dough to remain on the softer side.)",
      "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 3 minutes (for a visual, watch me knead in the video above). If you\u2019d rather use the mixer to knead it, beat the dough on low speed for 3 minutes instead. After kneading, poke the dough with your finger\u2014if it slowly bounces back, the dough is ready for the next step. If not, keep kneading.",
      "Form the dough into a ball on your work surface. Cover it with a clean towel, aluminum foil, or plastic wrap, then let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. Alternatively, the ball of dough can rest in a covered and lightly greased mixing bowl.",
      "Make the filling:\u00a0After 30 minutes, use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a 15\u00d712 inch rectangle. Evenly spread the softened butter on top. Mix the sugar and cinnamon together and sprinkle it all over the buttered dough.",
      "Grease a 9-inch round pie dish or 9-inch round cake pan with butter or nonstick spray.",
      "Shape the cinnamon roll cake: See the video tutorial and my step-by-step photos above for a visual of this shaping step. Using a very sharp knife or a pizza cutter, cut the dough into six 2-inch wide strips. Roll up one strip and place it in the center of the pan. Coil the remaining 5 strips around the center roll, starting each strip at the end of the previous one to make one large cinnamon roll. Some of the filling may spill out as you pick up the strips, so just sprinkle it on top of the cake when you\u2019re done shaping it.",
      "Loosely cover the cake with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and allow it to rise in a relatively warm, draft-free environment for 1-2 hours or until double in size. (Tip: Rising at room temperature is usually fine, but on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C). Turn the oven off, place the shaped cake inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it\u2019s doubled in size, remove from the oven.)",
      "Bake: After the cake\u2019s dough has doubled in size, preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden brown. If you notice the top or edges browning too quickly, tent the cake with aluminum foil. While the giant cinnamon roll cake is baking, some spots may rise up more than other spots. That\u2019s completely normal and expected from something this large. Simply remove the pan from the oven and, with the back of a spatula, press down the spots that are rising taller than others to help keep them even. Return to baking.",
      "Remove the finished cinnamon roll cake from the oven and cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, make the icing.",
      "Make the icing: Whisk the icing ingredients together. If you want a thicker icing, whisk in more confectioners\u2019 sugar. If you want a thinner icing, whisk in more milk or cream. Drizzle all over warm cake and serve.",
      "The cinnamon roll cake is best enjoyed the same day it\u2019s made, but will remain fresh covered tightly for up to 4 days in the refrigerator."

      "Overnight Instructions: The night before serving, prepare the cinnamon roll cake through step 6. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 8-12 hours. The next morning, remove from the refrigerator and allow to rise on the counter, covered, for 1-2 hours before continuing with step 8.",

You can also freeze the unbaked cinnamon roll cake and here\u2019s how: bake the cake in step 8 for only about 10 minutes. Cool completely, then cover tightly and freeze.

Cocoa powder is simply not as structurally strong as all-purpose flour and can\u2019t hold up to all the moisture necessary to make a moist tasting chocolate cake. It\u2019s normal!)",
      "Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack.\u00a0Allow to cool completely in the pan.",
      "Make the buttercream: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy \u2013 about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners\u2019 sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is too thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is too thick. (I usually add 1 more.) Taste. Add another pinch of salt if desired.",
      "Assemble and frost: If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called \u201cleveling\u201d the cakes. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula\u00a0and\u00a0bench scraper for the frosting. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired.",
      "Refrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing to help set the shape. After that, you can serve the cake or continue refrigerating for up to 4\u20136 hours before serving. Cake can be served at room temperature or chilled.",
      "Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days. I like using a cake carrier for storing and transporting."

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Prepare cake through step 4. Wrap the individual baked and cooled cake layers tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze up to 3 months. Bring to room temperature then continue with step 5. You can prepare the chocolate buttercream 2-3 days in advance. Cover and refrigerate, then bring to room temperature before spreading onto/assembling the cake. Frosted cake freezes well, up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature or serve cold.",

      "3 Layer Cake: You can also prepare this cake as a 3 layer cake. Divide batter between three 8-inch or 9-inch cake pans in step 1 and bake for 22-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. This frosting will be enough for 3 layers. If desired, use the frosting recipe from my Pi\u00f1ata Cake if you want extra frosting.",
      "Cocoa Powder: Use natural cocoa powder in the cake, not dutch-process. (See dutch-process vs natural cocoa powder for more information.) Since there is no leavening occurring in frosting, you can use either natural or dutch-process in the chocolate buttercream.",
      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk is required for this recipe. You can make your own DIY version of buttermilk if needed. Add 2 teaspoons of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough room temperature whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1 cup. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe.",
      "Sour Cream Version: Lately I\u2019ve been using a mix of sour cream and buttermilk, as well as reducing the hot coffee. Reduce the buttermilk and hot coffee to 1/2 cup (120ml) each. Add 3/4 cup (180g) of room temperature full-fat sour cream with the wet ingredients. You can see this described above, in the video tutorial, and in my dark chocolate mousse cake. That cake and this cake are both fantastically moist, but the sour cream version has a slightly sturdier crumb.",
      "FAQ: The sour cream version (note above) makes a sturdy enough cake that will hold under fondant.",
      "Amount of Cake Batter: This recipe (and the sour cream version) yields about 6 cups of batter, which is helpful if you need it for different Cake Pan Sizes & Conversions.",
      "Room Temperature Ingredients: All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly. Read more about why room temperature ingredients are important.",
      "Espresso Powder/Coffee: Espresso powder and coffee will not make the cake taste like coffee. Instead, they deepen the chocolate flavor. I highly recommend them both. You can use the same amount of instant coffee (the powder) instead of espresso powder if desired. If coffee isn\u2019t your thing, you can leave out the espresso powder and use extra hot water or hot chai tea.",
      "Bundt Pan: I recommend my chocolate cream cheese bundt cake but without the cream cheese filling. Reduce buttermilk in that recipe to 1/4 cup and increase sour cream to 1 cup.",
      "9\u00d713 Inch Pan: You can bake this cake in a 9\u00d713-inch baking pan. Same oven temperature, about 35-40 minutes bake time.",
      "Chocolate Cupcakes: Here is my favorite chocolate cupcakes recipe. Same unbelievable texture as this cake! (You\u2019ll notice I don\u2019t use hot liquid in that recipe. That\u2019s because there isn\u2019t the same volume of dry ingredients to break up. If you need more than 1 dozen chocolate cupcakes, use this chocolate cake recipe for 2-3 dozen. Same baking instructions as my chocolate cupcakes."

      "Before beginning this recipe, watch the video tutorial above, read the entire blog post, read the recipe instructions, and review the recipe notes. Make sure you\u2019re prepared with the recommended special tools, which are listed right above this recipe.",
      "Make each cake separately. Start with the bottom tier (9-inch cake). Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease three 9\u00d72 inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)",
      "Whisk the cake flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Beat in the 3 eggs, 2 egg whites, and vanilla extract on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. (Mixture will look curdled as a result of the egg liquid and solid butter combining.) Beat in the sour cream. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk until combined. Do not over-mix. Whisk it all by hand a few times to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick. You\u2019ll have 8-9 cups of cake batter. Pour batter evenly into cake pans.\u00a0Weigh them\u00a0to ensure accuracy, if desired. Bake for around 23-26 minutes or until the cakes are baked through.\u00a0To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it\u2019s done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Keep the oven on.",
      "For the top tier (6-inch cake)\u00a0prepare three 6\u00d72 inch cake pans just as you did with the 9-inch cake pans in step 2. (Greasing with parchment paper rounds.)",
      "Prepare the 6-inch cake batter the same exact way as the bottom tier. You\u2019ll have about 4 cups of cake batter. The batter will be thinner than the bottom tier\u2019s cake batter. Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Weigh them to ensure accuracy, if desired. Bake for around 18-22 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it\u2019s done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of all the cakes to create a flat surface. This is called leveling off the cakes. Discard the leveled off piece (or crumble over ice cream!).",
      "Make the frosting for the 9 inch cake (which is enough for the piping detail, too): In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, milk, vanilla extract, and salt with the mixer running on low. Increase to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Add more confectioners\u2019 sugar if frosting is too thin, more milk if frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.",
      "You can prepare the rest of the frosting now (step 11), if desired, or begin decorating the 9-inch tier. Place your 9-10 inch cake board on your cake turner. Place 1 cake layer on your cake board. Using a large icing spatula, evenly cover the top with a scant 1 and 1/2 cups of frosting. Top with 2nd cake layer and evenly cover the top with a scant 1 and 1/2 cups of frosting. Top with the third cake layer. Using about 1-1 and 1/4 cups of frosting, spread it all over the top and sides in a thin layer, also called a crumb coat. A large icing spatula and bench scraper are helpful for applying the crumb coat. Set leftover frosting aside at room temperature. If you are decorating this cake in stages over 1-2 days, cover and refrigerate this leftover frosting.",
      "Using the cake board to pick up the cake (be careful, it\u2019s heavy), place the cake in the refrigerator to help set the crumb coat as you work on the top tier.",
      "Make the frosting for the 6 inch cake, just as you prepared the 1st batch of frosting. (Step 8.) Before adding any salt, taste the frosting, then add a pinch if desired. I always add a small pinch.",
      "Place your 6-inch cake board on your cake turner. Place 1 6-inch cake layer on your cake board. Using a small icing spatula, evenly cover the top with a scant 3/4 cup of frosting. Top with 2nd cake layer and evenly cover the top with a scant 3/4 cup of frosting. Top with the third cake layer. Using about 3/4 cup of frosting, spread it all over the top and sides in a thin layer, also called a crumb coat. A small icing spatula and bench scraper are helpful for applying the crumb coat. Set leftover frosting aside at room temperature. If you are decorating this cake in stages over 1-2 days, cover and refrigerate this leftover frosting.",
      "Using the cake board to pick up the 6-inch cake, carefully place the cake in the refrigerator to help set the crumb coat as you work on the exterior frosting on the top tier.",
      "Remove the bottom tier from the refrigerator (along with the cake board) and place on the cake turner. Apply the remaining frosting for the bottom tier on the cake, reserving about 6-8 Tablespoons for piping detail. I recommend a large icing spatula and bench scraper to apply the outer layer of frosting. For the decorative textured frosting as pictured, see my video above. As shown in the video, use a small icing spatula and run it around the cake while spinning with the cake turner. You will love this look because it\u2019s very easy, but resembles beautiful ruffles. Carefully lift the cake (with the cake board) and place on your serving platter or cake stand.",
      "Wash and dry 4 cake dowels. Measure the height of the bottom cake. Measure and cut the cake dowels to match. Staying within a 6 inch circle diameter (you can use another 6 inch cake board to \u201cimprint\u201d a 6-inch circle in the very center of the top of the 9-inch cake), insert the dowels into the cake, spacing them about 2 inches apart to form 4 corners of a square. Push the dowels straight down until each touches the bottom cake board. Set aside.",
      "Remove the top tier from the refrigerator (along with the cake board) and place on the cake turner. Decorate just as you did the bottom tier, including the ruffled textured frosting. I also turn the cake on the cake turner and apply this ruffled look on top of the 6-inch cake, too. This is optional. Along with the cake board, carefully lift the small cake and gently place it in the very center of the bottom tier.",
      "Piping: After placing the small tier on top, you can pipe leftover frosting around the bottom of it. This covers up any spaces or smears that may have appeared when arranging the top tier. I pipe dots of frosting with Wilton piping tip #12 between the tiers as well as around the bottom of the whole cake. They resemble pretty pearls. To smooth down pointy peaks on these \u201cpearls,\u201d moisten your fingertip with water and gently press down on the peak.",
      "Add any decorative pieces, such as artificial flowers.",
      "Cake is best enjoyed within 3 days. Refrigerate cake until ready to serve. After a few hours, the frosting will \u201cset\u201d and you can lightly cover with plastic wrap.",
      "Cover any leftover cake tightly and refrigerate for up to 1 week."

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Assembled cake is best enjoyed within 3 days. Refrigerate assembled cake until ready to serve. After a few hours, the frosting will \u201cset\u201d and you can lightly cover with plastic wrap until ready to display and serve. You can make the cake ahead of time before assembling it, too. The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Let the frosting sit at room temperature to slightly soften for 20 minutes before assembling and frosting. (You may need to beat the refrigerated frosting in the mixer for 1-2 minutes if it\u2019s particularly solid. Feel free to add a Tablespoon of milk or heavy cream to soften it up as it mixes, too.) Crumb-coated cakes can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Cover with 2 layers of plastic wrap and 1 layer of aluminum foil. Freeze. When ready, thaw overnight in the refrigerator. Unfrosted cake layers can also be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving.

      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2-3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. On medium speed, beat in the vanilla extract. On low speed, beat the eggs in 1 at a time allowing each to fully mix in before adding the next. After the 3rd egg is added, be careful not to over-mix. Stop the mixer once all eggs are incorporated.",
      "Pour the dry ingredients into the butter/eggs. Pour the yogurt mixture on top. Turn the mixer onto medium speed and beat everything together *just* until combined. Do not over-mix. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the berries. The batter will be a little thick and very creamy.",
      "Pour/spoon batter evenly into prepared pan. Bake for 55-70 minutes. Loosely tent the baking cake with aluminum foil halfway through bake time to ensure the surface does not over-brown. Use a toothpick to test for doneness and begin checking at 55 minutes. Once the toothpick comes out completely clean, the cake is done. This is a large cake so don\u2019t be alarmed if it takes longer in your oven.",
      "Remove cake from the oven and allow to cool for 1 hour inside the pan. Then invert the slightly cooled cake onto a wire rack or serving dish. Allow to cool completely before glazing, slicing, and serving.",
      "Make the glaze: Whisk the glaze ingredients together. If desired, add more confectioners\u2019 sugar to thicken or more lemon juice to thin out. Drizzle on top of cooled cake. Icing will set after a few hours, making this cake convenient for storing and/or transporting.",

    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: Wrap unglazed baked and cooled cake in 1-2 layers of plastic wrap, then a layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 3 months. Allow to thaw in the plastic wrap & foil overnight in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature before glazing, slicing, and serving.",

      "Cake Flour:\u00a0For the best results, I strongly recommend cake flour. You can find it in the baking aisle and I have\u00a0many more recipes\u00a0using it. If you cannot get your hands on cake flour, you can make a DIY\u00a0cake flour substitute.",
      "Yogurt: You can use plain Greek yogurt, plain yogurt, or even sour cream. I recommend low-fat,\u00a0 non-fat, or full fat yogurt. If using sour cream, use full fat.",
      "Lemons: 2 medium/large lemons will be enough for the cake and glaze. If you\u2019re looking for a plain yogurt cake (no lemon flavor), simply leave out the lemon zest and replace the lemon juice with milk (dairy or nondairy) in both the cake and glaze.",
      "Berries: I recommend sticking with mostly blueberries and chopped strawberries. Some raspberries and/or blackberries are OK, but they become a little wet and mushy and can impact the color and consistency of the baked cake. I use 3/4 cup blueberries, 3/4 cup chopped strawberries, and 1/4 cup each raspberries and blackberries. You can use frozen berries if needed. Do not thaw."

    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) and grease a 9\u00d713 inch baking pan or line with parchment paper. You can use a glass, ceramic, or metal baking pan. The bake time is similar for each, but use a toothpick to test for doneness. Metal baking pans cook cakes faster. Set pan aside.",
      "Make the crumb topping: Mix the brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a medium bowl. Stir in the melted butter, then gently mix the flour using a fork. Keep the mixture as large crumbles, do not over-mix. If over-mixed, this will turn into a thick paste. Set aside.",
      "Make\u00a0the cake:\u00a0Whisk the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the eggs, sour cream, and the vanilla. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. The mixture may look curdled; that\u2019s ok. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, mix in the dry ingredients until smooth. Do not over-mix. The batter will be thick, creamy, and sticky.",
      "Spread the batter evenly into prepared baking pan. Top with crumb topping. Using a rubber spatula or the back of a large spoon, press the crumb topping tightly down into the cake so it sticks.",
      "Bake for 45-55 minutes. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours and begin checking at 45 minutes. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If you find the top or edges of the cake is/are browning too quickly in the oven, loosely cover it with aluminum foil.",
      "Remove the cake from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to slightly cool for at least 30-45 minutes before cutting. If desired, dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar before slicing and serving. Use a\u00a0sifter/fine mesh sieve."

      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Stand Mixer or Handheld Mixer | 9\u00d713 Pan | Sifter/Fine Mesh Sieve\u00a0",
      "Sour Cream: Sour cream is a key ingredient in this cake. I don\u2019t suggest subbing the sour cream with a liquid\u2013 plain full-fat yogurt would work though. I don\u2019t recommend removing fat from this cake by using a lower fat yogurt or sour cream alternative.",
      "Room Temperature:\u00a0All\u00a0refrigerated items should be\u00a0at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly.\u00a0Read here for more information on room temperature ingredients.",
      "Crumb Cake Muffins: Interested in making this cake into muffins? Standard size muffins (12 count muffin pan) or jumbo size muffins (6 count muffin pan) are best\u2013 I don\u2019t recommend mini muffins because the crumbs are too large. Grease muffin cups or line muffin pan(s) with liners. Fill with batter to the near top of the muffin cup. Press crumbs tightly on top of the batter to help prevent them from falling off as the muffins rise. Bake at 425\u00b0F for 5 minutes, then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) and continue to bake for 15-17 for regular size muffins (20-22 minutes total) or another 22-23 minutes for jumbo size muffins (27-28 minutes total). Yields at least 2 dozen standard muffins and 10 jumbo muffins."

      "Spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Top with the streusel. If you have any extras, dot the top of the cake with a few raspberries and chocolate chips.",
      "Bake for about 45-46 minutes if using an 8-inch or 9-inch baking pan, though that time changes if you used a different size baking pan. That time is a guideline; the cake is done when a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. If the cake is browning too quickly on top, loosely tent with aluminum foil as it bakes.",
      "Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving. You can also let the cake cool completely before slicing and serving.",

      "Cake Pan Sizes: You can bake this cake in a 9-inch square baking pan, a 9-inch pie dish, an 11\u00d77-inch baking pan, or an oval baker that\u2019s about 9-10 inches long. Anything that holds 8-10 cups of batter works. The bake time slightly changes, so keep your eye on the cake after about 42 minutes and have a toothpick handy to check for doneness. For a 9\u00d75-inch loaf pan, bake for at least 60-65 minutes. For muffins, follow the same baking instructions as my blueberry streusel muffins. For a larger 9\u00d713-inch cake, double the recipe. The bake time will be a little longer, but use a toothpick to test for doneness.",
      "Chocolate Chips: You can use milk chocolate, white chocolate, semi-sweet, or dark/bittersweet chocolate chips.",
      "Buttermilk: You can substitute whole milk for buttermilk if desired. Acidic buttermilk isn\u2019t needed in order for the cake to rise since we\u2019re using baking powder. However if you\u2019d like the tangy flavor, you can make your own sour milk substitute. Add 2 teaspoons of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1 cup. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe."

Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed. Beat in the 3 eggs, 2 egg whites, and vanilla extract on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. (Mixture will look curdled as a result of the egg liquid and solid butter combining.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients. With the mixer still running on low speed, slowly pour in the buttermilk then mix just until combined. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.",
      "Pour batter evenly into cake pans. If desired, weigh them with a kitchen scale to ensure accuracy. Set aside for a few minutes as you make the cinnamon swirl.",
      "For the cinnamon swirl: With a fork, mix the brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon together until combined. Pour the melted butter on top and mix just until combined. Use immediately in the cake batter (next step) because the longer it sits out, the harder it will get as a result of the butter solidifying.",
      "Drop small spoonfuls of the cinnamon swirl on each of the unbaked cakes. Use a knife to gently swirl the spoonfuls into the batter. Some pieces will remain as chunks (that\u2019s fine!) and some will swirl into the batter.",
      "Bake for around 23-26 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it\u2019s done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Make the frosting:\u00a0In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Switch the mixer up to medium-high speed and add the cream cheese one piece at a time, mixing until each has combined before adding the next. Once the cream cheese is combined, add the brown sugar and beat on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer and add the cinnamon, confectioners\u2019 sugar, heavy cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Turn the mixer on low speed and beat for 30 seconds, then turn the mixer up to medium-high speed and beat until completely combined and creamy. Add more confectioners\u2019 sugar if frosting seems too thin\u2014I usually add another 1/4 cup (30g) of confectioners\u2019 sugar. You can add more heavy cream if frosting seems too thick or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. (I usually add another pinch of salt.) If you crave extra flavor, add a little more cinnamon and/or vanilla extract.",

Discard domes (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on a cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Evenly spread about 1 and 1/2 cups of frosting on top. Top with 2nd cake layer and evenly spread another 1 and 1/2 cups of frosting on top. Top with the third cake layer. I decorated my snickerdoodle cake with a crumb coat, which makes it a semi-naked style cake. To recreate this, spread a thin layer of frosting around the sides and top of the cake (save extra frosting for the top in the next step). An icing spatula and bench scraper are helpful for creating this look. (If you need a visual, see my Naked Cake video tutorial.) Chill the crumb coated cake uncovered in the refrigerator or freezer for at least 30 minutes to help set the crumb coat.",

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Let the frosting sit at room temperature to slightly soften for 20 minutes before assembling and frosting. Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving. See how to freeze cakes for detailed instructions.",

      "Cupcakes:\u00a0Fill cupcake liners 2/3 full with batter. Drop small spoonfuls of cinnamon swirl onto each, then gently swirl with a knife. Bake at 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) for 19-21 minutes. Yields about 3 dozen. Or try my snickerdoodle cupcakes recipe.",
      "9\u00d713-Inch Cake: This recipe yields too much batter for a 9\u00d713-inch pan. Instead, you can use my white cake batter and swirl in the cinnamon swirl. (See those recipe notes for baking instructions for a quarter sheet pan.) I recommend cutting this frosting recipe in half so you don\u2019t have too much leftover.",
      "Cake Flour:\u00a0To prevent a dry-tasting cake, make sure you are spooning and leveling the flour or weighing it.\u00a0For the best results, I strongly recommend cake flour. You can find it in the baking aisle and I have\u00a0many more recipes\u00a0using it. If you can\u2019t get your hands on cake flour, you can make a homemade\u00a0cake flour substitute.",
      "Eggs:\u00a03 whole eggs provide structure, moisture, and richness. 2 extra egg whites keep the cake light and airy. I don\u2019t recommend using 4 whole eggs; stick to the 3 egg & 2 egg white combination. Here are recipes using leftover\u00a0egg yolks.",
      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk (an acid) is required for this cake recipe. If you don\u2019t have any, you can make a DIY sour milk substitute. Add 2 teaspoons of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1 and 1/2 cups. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe.",
      "Cinnamon: Yes, the cinnamon swirl and frosting both call for 1 Tablespoon (not teaspoon) of ground cinnamon. We need that flavor to stand out!",
      "Brown Sugar: You can use light brown or dark brown sugar, but I recommend dark brown sugar for bolder flavor.",
      "Cream Cheese: Use brick cream cheese, not cream cheese spread. Slice the brick into four 2-ounce pieces. If desired, you can skip the cream cheese and add another 1/4 cup (4 Tbsp; 56g) softened unsalted butter instead.",
      "Why is everything at room temperature? All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly. Read more about the importance of room temperature ingredients.\u00a0"

      "Make the cakes: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)",
      "Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the egg whites, sour cream, and vanilla. Beat on high speed until fully combined and mixed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Pour the dry ingredients into the bowl. Then with the mixer running on low, slowly pour in the milk. Do not over-mix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.",
      "Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 24-25 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Cool cakes in the pans set on a wire rack for 30 minutes, then remove the cakes and cool completely directly on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Make the buttercream: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, milk/cream, vanilla extract, and salt with the mixer running on low. Increase to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes. Taste. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is way too sweet. Frosting will be thick.",
      "Tint the frosting:\u00a0Place 1 cup + 2 Tablespoons (about 1 heaping cup or 275g) of frosting into a medium bowl. This will remain white and be used for the cake\u2019s filling and to form Elmo\u2019s eyes and nose. Place 1/3 cup (about 85g) of frosting into a small bowl. Stir in 3 drops of black gel food coloring until it\u2019s dark gray. (Keep in mind that frosting dries darker.) Tint the remaining frosting red using about 4-5 big drops of red gel food coloring. Tint until you are satisfied with the color. Remember, frosting dries darker.",
      "Level the cakes & add the crumb coat: Using a large serrated knife, slice the domes off the cooled cakes (a semi-thin layer) to create a flat surface. Place tops into a bowl to use in step 9. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, serving plate, or cake turntable. Spread 1 cup (about 250g) of white untinted frosting all over the top. (Reserve remaining white frosting for step 9.) Top with 2nd layer. Spread a thin layer of red frosting around the sides and top of the cake. This is your crumb coat and should be a pretty thin layer. An icing spatula and bench scraper are helpful for this. See video tutorial below. Chill uncovered in the refrigerator or freezer for at least 30 minutes to help set the crumb coat.",
      "Meanwhile, shape Elmo\u2019s eyes and nose: Crumble the pieces of cake that you leveled off into crumbs. I just use my hands for this. Stir in 1 Tablespoon of white frosting. If the mixture still seems pretty crumby and dry, add a little more of the white frosting until you have a moist mixture that you can form into shapes. Mixture shouldn\u2019t be overly wet. Form into 3 shapes: two 2-inch discs for Elmo\u2019s eyes and one 3-inch oval/egg shape for Elmo\u2019s nose. Smooth them out as best you can. Place on a lined baking sheet and chill in the refrigerator or freezer for at least 30 minutes to set. Once they\u2019re set, you can smooth out any bumps on the surface with your hands if needed.",
      "Meanwhile, pipe Elmo\u2019s fur:\u00a0First, spread a thin layer of black frosting on the bottom half of the top of the cake. Use a small offset spatula to help ensure it\u2019s perfectly smooth. Reserve remaining black frosting. Using a toothpick, trace/outline Elmo\u2019s mouth shape within the black frosting. Use it as your guide for piping his fur around it. Fit your piping bag with Wilton piping tip #233 (grass tip). Spoon some red frosting inside. It\u2019s difficult to pipe this frosting if the bag is over-filled, so just work with a little bit of frosting in the bag at a time. Place the tip directly on top of the cake\u2019s surface and apply pressure to squeeze the frosting out of the tip. Quickly lift the tip up while squeezing the frosting out. The video tutorial below is helpful for this step. Pipe his fur all over the top and sides of the cake. (The sides are optional, but if you have enough frosting, go for it!) It\u2019s helpful to carefully tilt the cake stand/turntable so you can more easily pipe frosting on the sides. Set cake aside. You can refrigerate uncovered if desired as you finish Elmo\u2019s eyes and nose.",
      "Melt the chocolate: You can melt the chocolate and oil together in a double boiler or the microwave. If using the microwave: place the chopped chocolate and oil in a medium heat-proof bowl. Melt in 20 second increments in the microwave, stirring after each increment until completely melted and smooth. Place one of the discs (eyes) into the white chocolate. Use a fork to help fully coat it. Using a fork, lift the disc (eye) out of the chocolate. Place back onto lined baking sheet. Repeat with 2nd disc (eye). Stir 1 drop of orange gel food coloring into the remaining melted chocolate. Coat Elmo\u2019s nose just how you coated the eyes. Refrigerate or freeze for 20 minutes or until white chocolate has set. I find the orange becomes a little darker as it dries.",
      "After the white chocolate sets, fit your piping bag with Wilton tip #12 (round tip). Spoon some black frosting inside. Pipe Elmo\u2019s pupils onto the eyes. Carefully press the eyes and nose on top of the cake to form Elmo\u2019s face.",
      "If you decorated the cake on a cake turntable, use a couple thin spatulas (and a helper!) to carefully lift the cake off the turntable and onto a cake stand, server, or cake carrier base. I actually like to use a cake carrier to cover and store my cakes in the refrigerator.",
      "Serve cake. Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: You can prepare the cake layers ahead of time. Wrap the individual baked and cooled cake layers tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 days. You can also assemble the cake with Elmo\u2019s mouth & piped fur 2 days ahead of time, too. You can also make, coat in white chocolate, cover, and refrigerate Elmo\u2019s nose and eyes ahead of time, too. Do not place on cake until the day of serving as the red from Elmo\u2019s fur may smear onto the eyes and nose. Pipe Elmo\u2019s pupils the day of serving because the black can smear down onto his eyes if refrigerated ahead of time. It did this for me, so I just carefully wiped it off.",
      "Freezing Instructions: Freeze the cake layers for up to 3 months. See How to Freeze Cake for instructions. Bring cake layers to room temperature, then continue with step 6.",

      "Whole Milk & Sour Cream: Whole milk and sour cream are strongly recommended for the best taste and texture. A full fat plain yogurt would work instead, though the cake may not be as light. Same goes with a lower fat milk.",
      "White Chocolate: Use real white chocolate to coat Elmo\u2019s eyes and nose. You can use high quality white chocolate chips if needed (I prefer Ghirardelli brand), but I recommend using pure chocolate baking bars. You can find them right next to the chocolate chips in the baking aisle. They are sold in 4 ounce bars. I like Bakers or Ghirardelli brands. You can also use 8 ounces of candy melts.",

Best to use a 3 quart heavy-bottomed quality saucepan. Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, cook until the sugar has completely melted and is amber brown, about 8-10 minutes. If the sugar is clumpy, break up the lumps with your wooden spoon. A candy thermometer is not necessary, but if you\u2019re using one, the sugar temperature should reach about 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) when it\u2019s ready. Turn the heat to low and very carefully and slowly drizzle in the boiling water, a little at a time. Stir after each addition and stand back, as the mixture will rapidly sizzle and bubble. After all of the boiling water is stirred in, stir and cook the sugar syrup for 3 more minutes on low. Turn off the heat and let it cool completely, overnight preferred.

      "As the cakes cool, I suggest making the salted caramel. The salted caramel adds necessary flavor. We\u2019ll use it as a filling and garnish. When ready to use in step 9, make sure the salted caramel isn\u2019t too hot anymore. If it\u2019s too hot, it will melt the frosting. If it\u2019s too cool, it won\u2019t drizzle. Let it cool for at least 30 minutes before using. If you prepared the salted caramel ahead of time and it became too cool or too thick, microwave it for 5-10 seconds or JUST until it\u2019s drizzle-able again. (It won\u2019t be too hot at this point.) You can also toast the pecans during this time, too. See recipe note.",
      "Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 1-2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, remaining 1/2 cup of cooled burnt sugar syrup, vanilla extract, milk/cream, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat until completely combined, about 2 minutes. Add more confectioners\u2019 sugar if frosting is too thin or more milk/cream if frosting is too thick. Taste. Add more salt if desired. (I usually use 1/2 teaspoon of salt total. I like this frosting salty/sweet.)",
      "Assemble and frost:\u00a0First, using a large serrated knife or cake leveler, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). If you have any leftover burnt sugar syrup, drizzle over leveled cakes. I usually don\u2019t have any leftover, but this is a great place to use any last drops if you have some. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Using a large icing spatula, evenly cover the top with frosting. Drizzle 1/4 cup of salted caramel on top of the frosting. Top with 2nd cake layer. Refrigerate the cake for at least 30-45 minutes before finishing the frosting and garnish. The caramel inside the cake must \u201cset.\u201d After chilling in the refrigerator, spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides. Run a\u00a0bench scraper around the cake to smooth out the sides, if desired. Garnish with toasted pecans and more salted caramel. Slice and serve.",

Wrap the individual baked and cooled cake layers tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze up to 3 months. (See How to Freeze Cake\u00a0for instructions.)

      "3 Layer Cake or 9\u00d713-Inch Cake: You can also prepare this cake as a 3 layer cake or 9\u00d713-inch sheet cake, but the texture tastes best at the thickness of a 2 layer cake. I highly recommend sticking to a 2 layer cake. For a 3 layer cake, though, divide batter between three 8-inch or 9-inch cake pans in step 3 and bake for 20-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. For a 9\u00d713-inch cake, pour the batter into a greased and lightly floured 9\u00d713-inch pan and bake for 40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

      "Toasted Pecans: Toasting the pecans is optional, but adds incredible flavor to the garnish. To toast, preheat the oven to 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C). Spread chopped pecans onto a parchment paper or silicone baking mat lined baking sheet. Toast until slightly darkened, about 5-7 minutes. Cool before using as garnish."

      "Espresso Powder/Coffee: Espresso powder and coffee will not make the cake taste like coffee. Rather, they deepen the chocolate flavor. I highly recommend them both. If coffee isn\u2019t your thing, you can leave out the espresso powder and use extra hot water instead of the hot coffee.",
      "Cocoa Powder: For the best dark chocolate flavor in the cake, I recommend using a blend of unsweetened natural cocoa powder (1/4 cup; 22g) and Hershey\u2019s \u201cSpecial Dark\u201d cocoa powder (1/2 cup; 43g). Hershey\u2019s Special Dark is actually a mix of natural cocoa powder (an acid) and dutch-process cocoa powder (a base) and it worked fine in this recipe. This recipe needs acidic natural cocoa powder, so do not use ALL dutch-process cocoa powder. For best results, use 3/4 cup (65g) natural or the blend of natural/Special Dark I used. For the chocolate mousse, you can use either unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder. (Or the Hershey\u2019s Special Dark.)",
      "Why Room Temperature? All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly. Read more about why room temperature ingredients are important. Instead of sour cream, you can use plain yogurt. The cake won\u2019t taste as rich, but it\u2019s a fine substitute.",
      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk is required for this recipe. You can make your own DIY version of buttermilk if needed. Add 1 teaspoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1/2 cup. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe.",
      "Chocolate in Mousse & Ganache: Mousse & ganache will only set if the correct chocolate is used. You can use high quality chocolate chips if needed (I prefer Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips), but I recommend using pure chocolate baking bars. You can find them right next to the chocolate chips in the baking aisle. They are sold in 4 ounce bars. I like Bakers or Ghirardelli brands."

      "1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",

    "instructions": [
      "For best success, follow this recipe closely, be prepared with all of the special tools you need (see recipe notes), and watch the video tutorial in the blog post.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease a 12\u00d717 inch baking pan with nonstick spray or butter, line it with parchment paper, grease the parchment paper, then dust with a very light layer of flour. (A sifter helps.) Parchment paper helps the cake seamlessly release from the pan. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post, but note that you\u2019ll use a rectangular piece of parchment paper for this cake.)",
      "Make the cake: Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat the eggs in a large bowl on high speed for 5 minutes until pale yellow and relatively thick. Switch the mixer to medium speed and beat in the sugar, vanilla, and oil just until combined, about 1 minute. Set aside.",
      "Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. In 2 or 3 additions, sift the dry ingredients over the egg mixture, gently folding together after each addition. You do NOT want to deflate the eggs. Make sure there are no pockets of dry ingredients. Batter is thick and airy.",
      "Spread batter evenly into prepared pan. You\u2019ll really have to stretch the batter out to fit this pan. It will be a thin layer. Tap the whole pan on the counter a few times to pop any air bubbles on top.",
      "(As the cake bakes, complete step 7.) Bake for 12-13 minutes or until cake is set and the top springs back when lightly poked with your finger. Do not over-bake.",
      "As the cake bakes, place a piece of parchment paper (a little larger than the cake) or a thin kitchen towel flat on the counter. Using a sifter, dust with a light coating of confectioners\u2019 sugar.",
      "Roll the cake: Once the cake comes out of the oven, run a thin knife along the edges to help release the cake, then immediately invert it onto the parchment/towel. Peel off the parchment paper that was on the bottom of the cake as it baked. Using a sifter, dust surface with a light coating of confectioners\u2019 sugar. Starting with the narrow end, slowly and gently roll the cake up with the parchment/towel. The cake will be warm. Allow the cake to cool completely rolled up in the parchment/towel. Place in the refrigerator to speed it up, about 2-3 hours.",
      "As the cake cools, make the blueberry sauce:\u00a0The blueberry sauce must be completely cool before folding into the whipped cream, so make it ahead of time or when the cake is cooling. Mix the cornstarch and water together in a very small bowl. Set aside. Combine blueberries, lemon juice, and granulated sugar together in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir constantly, bursting the blueberries against the sides of the pan. Once the blueberries have released some liquid, add the cornstarch/water. Turn the heat up to medium. Stir and cook for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely. Mixture will thicken as it cools. I place it in the refrigerator to cool down quicker.",
      "Remove the cake roll from the refrigerator and allow to sit on the counter for a few minutes to warm up as you prepare the whipped cream.",
      "Make the whipped cream:\u00a0Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream and confectioners\u2019 sugar together on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3-4 minutes. Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and stiff peaks. Using a spoon or rubber spatula, gently fold in cooled blueberry sauce. If you want blueberry swirls as pictured, don\u2019t completely combine the two. Only fold together a few times. Place in the refrigerator until ready to use.",
      "Assemble vertical cake: Slowly and gently unroll the cake. If you notice the cake cracking, unroll slower and gently press the cracked pieces back together. (Some cracks are fine!) Using a very sharp knife or even kitchen shears, cut the cake into 3 long strips. Cake is about 11 inches wide (it shrinks when baking and cooling), so each strip will be a little over 3.5 inches wide. Spread whipped cream evenly on top of each strip. Working with 1 strip at a time, gently roll the cake strip back up, without the parchment/towel this time. Connect the end of the first rolled strip with the next, continuing to roll and wrap the cake up. See video above if you need a visual for this step.",
      "Turn cake upright on its flattest end and place on a cake turntable for decorating or if you don\u2019t wish to use a cake turntable for decorating, onto a cake stand or serving plate. Refrigerate covered or uncovered for at least 1 hour or freeze covered or uncovered for 45 minutes. Chilling helps ensure the cake holds its delicate shape.",
      "Make the cream cheese buttercream:\u00a0In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the butter and cream cheese together on medium speed until creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla extract with the mixer running on low. Increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes. Add more confectioners\u2019 sugar if frosting is too thin, more lemon juice if frosting is too thick, or a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.",
      "Remove cake from the refrigerator or freezer. Spread the frosting all over the top and sides. A bench scraper\u00a0and\u00a0small offset spatula are handy for decorating. Some of the whipped cream exposed on the top of the cake will mix with the buttercream, creating beautiful random swirls of purple. Garnish with fresh blueberries, if desired. If you decorated the cake on a cake turntable, use a couple thin spatulas (and a helper!) to carefully lift the cake off the turntable and onto a cake stand or server. (Decorating on a cake board is helpful for this, too.)",
      "Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.",
      "Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: The best way to make the vertical cake ahead of time is to complete the recipe through step 8, letting the rolled up cake chill overnight in the refrigerator before continuing with the recipe. Make the blueberry sauce (step 9) 1 day ahead of time as well. Cover tightly in the refrigerator overnight. You could also complete the recipe through step 13, letting the assembled vertical cake chill in the refrigerator for up to 1 day or freeze for up to 1 month. Cover tightly if chilling/freezing for longer than 1 hour. If frozen, thaw overnight in the refrigerator before continuing with step 14.",

      "Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Generously grease a 9\u00d713 inch cake pan.",
      "Sift the cake flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer. (Or if using a handheld mixer, any large mixing bowl.) With the paddle attachment, beat the ingredients together on low speed for a few seconds to gently combine. Add the butter, vanilla, and 1/2 cup of milk. Mix on medium speed until the dry ingredients are moistened, about 1 minute. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl. The mixture will resemble a thick dough.",
      "Whisk the remaining milk, the sour cream, and eggs together in a medium bowl. With the mixer running on medium speed, add the egg mixture in 3 additions, mixing for about 15 seconds after each addition. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl, then mix for about 15 more seconds until batter is completely combined. Avoid over-mixing. Some small lumps are OK.",
      "Pour and spread batter evenly into prepared pan. Bake for around 32-35 minutes or until the cake is baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it\u2019s done. Allow cake to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack. The cake must be completely cool before frosting.",
      "Make the buttercream:\u00a0With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to medium-high speed and beat for 4 full minutes. Add up to 1/4 cup more confectioners\u2019 sugar if frosting is too thin or another Tablespoon of cream if frosting is too thick. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. (I add 1/8 teaspoon salt.) Frosting should be extra fluffy.",
      "Spread frosting in a thick layer on cooled cake. I use and recommend an offset spatula. If desired, use a piping tip to pipe some frosting and/or garnish with sprinkles. Slice and serve.",
      "Cover leftover cake\u00a0tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: The cake can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Let the refrigerated frosting sit at room temperature for 10 minutes, then beat with a mixer for 1 minute to bring it back to a spreadable consistency. Frosted cake or unfrosted cake can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving.",

      "2 Layer Cake: If desired, you can use this batter to make a 2 layer cake instead. Grease two 9 inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. Divide the batter evenly between the pans. Bake time will be a few minutes shorter\u2014keep a close eye on the cakes at 20 minutes and check for doneness with a toothpick.",
      "Cake Flour: For the best results, I strongly recommend cake flour. You can find it in the baking aisle and I have\u00a0many more recipes using it. If you cannot get your hands on cake flour, you can make a DIY cake flour substitute.",
      "Why is everything at room temperature?\u00a0All\u00a0refrigerated items should be\u00a0at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly.\u00a0Read here for more\u00a0information.",
      "Sprinkle Cake: To make a sprinkle cake, fold about 2/3 cup (105g) of sprinkles into the cake batter. Avoid nonpareils (the little balls), which tend to bleed their color.",
      "Chocolate Frosting: If desired, swap the whipped vanilla buttercream with chocolate buttercream. The chocolate buttercream calls for beating for 1 minute, but for a fluffy whipped texture, whip for 3 full minutes."

      "In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip egg whites and cream of tartar together on medium-low until foamy, about 1 minute. Switch to medium-high and slowly add the 1 cup of sugar you set aside. Whip until soft peaks form, about 5-6 minutes. See photo and video above for a visual. Add the vanilla extract, then beat just until incorporated.",
      "In 3 additions, slowly sift the flour mixture into the egg white mixture using a fine mesh strainer, gently folding with a rubber spatula after each addition. To avoid deflating or a dense cake, don\u2019t add the flour mixture all at once. Sift and very slowly fold in several additions. This is important! Pour and spread batter into an ungreased 9 or 10 inch tube pan. Shimmy the pan on the counter to smooth down the surface.",
      "Bake the cake until a toothpick inserted comes out clean, about 40-45 minutes. Rotate the pan halfway through baking. The cake will rise up very tall while baking. Remove from the oven, then cool the cake completely upside-down set on a wire rack, about 3 hours. (Upside-down so the bottom of the tube pan is right-side up, see photo and video above.) Once cooled, run a thin knife around the edges and gently tap the pan on the counter until the cake releases.",
      "If desired, dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar. Slice the cake with a sharp serrated knife. Regular knives can easily squish the cake. Serve with whipped cream and fresh berries.",

      "Sugar: In this recipe, you use granulated sugar and pulse it in a food processor to make superfine sugar. If you have superfine sugar or caster sugar, use that. Pulse 3/4 cup of it with the dry ingredients in step 2. Use 1 cup of it in step 3.",
      "Egg Whites: I strongly recommend using fresh real egg whites instead of egg white substitutes, previously frozen egg whites, or egg whites from a carton. Separate the eggs when they\u2019re cold, then bring the egg whites to room temperature. Fresh room temperature egg whites whip into the fluffiest volume. With the extra yolks, make lemon curd or some of these recipes.",
      "Pan: An angel food cake pan (aka tube pan) is imperative. Do not use a Bundt pan. Angel food cake\u2019s structure and stability requires the tube pan\u2019s particular specifications. Some angel food cake pans come with little feet, which makes cooling the cake upside down easy. If your pan has feet, no need to use a wire rack. Whether your tube pan has feet or not, cool the cake upside down as directed in step 5."

(Note: I find a kitchen towel is better to help prevent cracking.) Using a fine mesh sieve, dust parchment/towel with 2 Tablespoons of cocoa powder. Once the cake comes out of the oven, quickly run a knife around the edges to loosen it. Immediately invert it onto the parchment/towel. Peel off the parchment paper that was on the bottom of the cake as it baked. Starting with the narrow end, begin tightly rolling the hot cake up with the parchment/towel. Do this slowly and gently. The cake will be warm. Allow the cake to cool completely rolled up in the parchment/towel. Feel free to place it in the refrigerator to speed it up, about 3 hours and up to 1 day. (Note that you must bring it back to room temperature before unrolling, so make sure you set aside enough time.)",

      "Slowly and gently unroll the cake. Spread whipped cream evenly on top, leaving about a 1/2 inch border around the cake. Gently roll the cake back up, without the parchment/towel this time. Place on a wire rack set on a baking sheet (to catch the extra ganache). Set aside on the counter or in the refrigerator as you prepare the ganache.",

(Do not let it come to a rapid boil\u2013 that\u2019s too hot.) Pour over chocolate, then let it sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften the chocolate.

    "instructions": [
      "Preheat oven to\u00a0325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C). Grease a 12\u00d717-inch half sheet pan, then line with parchment paper. Pan size is imperative. This batter won\u2019t fit into anything smaller. Likewise, the cake would be too thin if baked in larger pans.",
      "Make the cake: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the cream cheese and beat on high speed until completely smooth and combined, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute, then add the sour cream and vanilla and beat on high speed until combined and creamy. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.",
      "On low speed, beat the eggs in 1 at a time allowing each to fully mix in before adding the next. Careful not to overmix after the eggs have been added. Once the 6th egg is combined, stop the mixer and add the cake flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat on medium speed *just* until combined, then beat in the lemon juice. Try not overmix. Using a rubber spatula or sturdy whisk, give the batter a final turn to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be thick and creamy.",
      "Pour/spoon batter evenly into prepared pan. Bang the pan on the counter once or twice to bring up any air bubbles. Bake for 26-31 minutes. Use a toothpick to test for doneness. Once it comes out completely clean, the cake is done.",
      "Remove cake from the oven and allow to cool inside the pan. The cake will shrink down from the sides.",
      "Cut cake into sections: Watch video tutorial above for a visual on the entire petit fours assembly. Once cool, invert the cake onto a cutting board or the counter with the long side facing you. With a sharp knife (I find serrated knife is best here) or pizza cutter, slice cake in half horizontally. Then cut each long rectangle into 3 smaller rectangles. You\u2019ll now have 6 rectangles. Very carefully and slowly slice each in half as shown in the video above\u2014as if you were making a 1 layer cake a 2 layer cake. You now have 12 thin rectangles.",
      "Make the vanilla buttercream:\u00a0With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes. Add up to 1/4 cup more confectioners\u2019 sugar if frosting is too thin or another Tablespoon of cream if frosting is too thick. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. (I always add a pinch.)",
      "Add fillings: With a sharp knife, trim the ends off the rectangles that touched the pan. They\u2019re a little harder and uneven, which would create lopsided petit fours. Spread vanilla buttercream in a thick even layer on 4 rectangles. Spread both lemon curd and raspberry jam on 4 rectangles. (The remaining 4 rectangles are plain because they are the tops.) Go a little lighter on the raspberry jam and lemon curd compared to the vanilla buttercream. If there\u2019s too much, it creates a big mess when cutting the petit fours.",
      "Layer the petit fours: Place the lemon curd/raspberry jam rectangles on top of the vanilla buttercream rectangles. Layer the plain rectangle on top. Loosely cover each and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or freeze for 1 hour. They must chill before cutting into tiny petit fours.",
      "Cut into tiny petit fours: Once cold, slice each into 12 little squares. Arrange on a baking sheet and chill in the refrigerator or freezer as you melt the white chocolate.",
      "Add the topping/garnish:\u00a0Melt the white chocolate and oil together in a double boiler or in the microwave in 20 second increments, stopping and stirring after each until smooth and melted. If it seems too thick, add another drop of oil to thin out. Spoon or drizzle over petit fours. Top with optional garnish if desired.",
      "Cover and store petit fours in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions:\u00a0To make ahead, complete the recipe through step 9. Cover the rectangles tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw, then continue with the recipe. Prepared petit fours freeze well for up to 3 months without white chocolate topping. Top with white chocolate prior to serving. Thaw in the refrigerator or on the counter.",

      "White Chocolate: Use real white chocolate or white chocolate made for melting, not white chocolate chips. I use Ghirardelli brand white vanilla flavored melting chips. White chocolate chips DO NOT melt down into the proper consistency; it will be too thick and taste grainy. White baking chocolate is usually sold in 4 ounce bars in the baking aisle. I love Ghirardelli, Bakers, or Nestle brands."

Simmer the syrup for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and steep until completely cool. Strain the syrup through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl, then discard the lavender. You will use this \u201csoaking syrup\u201d in step 8. Can be made 1-2 days ahead. Cover and keep at room temperature until ready to use.",

Add more confectioners\u2019 sugar if frosting is too thin, more milk if frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet.

Top with 2nd cake layer and repeat, then place 3rd cake layer on top. If there\u2019s any remaining, spread a thin layer of white frosting all over the top and sides of cake to create a crumb coat. Chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Finally, spread the purple frosting all over the top and sides. I use and recommend an icing spatula to apply the frosting.\u00a0If there\u2019s any extra frosting, pipe decor on top. I piped a swirled border with Wilton 1M piping tip.

      "Egg Whites: Egg whites (no yolks) are KEY to the cake\u2019s fluffy texture. For best success, I recommend using fresh eggs instead of carton egg whites. (Using an egg separator is really handy!) Here are all my recipes using leftover egg yolks. Success tip: Eggs separate much easier when they\u2019re cold.",
      "Canned Coconut Milk: Canned coconut milk is a cooking ingredient, not a beverage. It is usually unsweetened, so make sure you\u2019re using unsweetened. It\u2019s usually found in the grocery store near the Thai food products. Do not use refrigerated carton coconut milk beverage. You need 1 cup for the cake, not the entire can. You use 2 more Tablespoons in the frosting.",
      "Sweetened Shredded Coconut: I recommend using sweetened shredded/flaked coconut. It\u2019s moister than unsweetened coconut and that makes a big difference in the cake\u2019s texture. If desired, pulse the coconut shreds in a food processor to chop them up so they aren\u2019t as long inside and outside of the cake. Chopping the coconut is optional.",
      "Cream Cheese: Use brick cream cheese, not cream cheese spread. If desired, you can use this vanilla buttercream instead (no cream cheese). Use canned coconut milk instead of milk and add 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract.",

      "Reduce the champagne: In a small saucepan over low heat, simmer the champagne, whisking occasionally, until it reduces down to 4 Tablespoons (1/4 cup). This usually takes around 20 minutes, but the time varies. Place reduced champagne in the refrigerator until completely cool.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease a 10\u00d715 inch baking pan with nonstick spray or butter, then line it with parchment paper so the cake seamlessly releases in step 7. Spray or grease the parchment paper too. We want an extremely nonstick surface for this cake roll.",
      "Make the cake: Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
      "Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with whisk\u00a0attachment, beat the egg whites and 1/4 cup sugar together on high speed for 4-5 minutes or until stiff peaks form. Transfer to another bowl. Using the same mixing bowl you just had the egg whites in (no need to clean it!), add the egg yolks, remaining sugar, 2 Tablespoons reduced champagne, and vanilla extract. Beat together on high speed for 3-4 minutes or until light in color.",
      "Add half of the whipped egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Beat on low speed for 10 seconds. Repeat with remaining egg whites and beat on low for 10 seconds. Finally, add the flour mixture and beat on low until the batter is completely combined. Do not overmix.",
      "Spread batter evenly into prepared pan. Bake for 15 minutes or until the cake springs back when poked with your finger.",
      "Roll the cake: As the cake bakes, place a piece of parchment paper (larger than the cake) or a thin kitchen\u00a0towel flat\u00a0on the counter. Sprinkle with 1 cup of confectioners\u2019 sugar. Once the cake comes out of the oven, immediately invert it onto the parchment/towel. Peel off the parchment paper that was on the bottom of the cake as it baked. Starting with the narrow end, begin rolling the cake up with the parchment/towel. Do this slowly and gently. The cake will be warm. Allow the cake to cool completely rolled up in the parchment/towel. Place in the refrigerator to speed it up, about 2 hours.",
      "Remove the cake roll from the refrigerator and allow to sit on the counter for a few minutes to warm up as you prepare the whipped cream.",
      "Make the whipped cream: Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk\u00a0attachment, whip the heavy cream, confectioners\u2019 sugar, 1 Tablespoon reduced champagne, and vanilla extract on medium-high speed until medium to stiff peaks form, about 2-3 minutes.",
      "Gently and slowly unroll the cake. Brush with remaining reduced champagne. Dust with cocoa powder, if desired. Spread whipped cream evenly on top, leaving about a 1/2 inch border around the cake. Gently roll the cake back up, without the parchment/towel this time. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes before slicing and serving. Dust with more confectioners\u2019 sugar, if desired.",
      "Cover leftover cake and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days."

      "Make Ahead Instructions:\u00a0Reduce the champagne up to 3 days in advance. Cover tightly and refrigerate until ready to use. You can prepare the cake through step 7\u00a0and chill the rolled up cake in the refrigerator for up to 1 day before continuing with step 8. Prepared cake roll, with whipped cream, freezes well for up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before slicing and serving. Prepare whipped cream up to 1 day in advance.

      "Make the chocolate cake: Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a KitchenAid stand mixer fitted with a flat beater, beat the oil, eggs, sour cream, buttermilk, and vanilla together until combined. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, add the hot water or coffee, and beat it all until the batter is completely combined.",
      "Divide batter evenly between 3 pans. Bake for 21-25 minutes. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool for 30 minutes in the pans, then remove cakes from pans and set on a cooling rack. Be careful and use two hands when handling the cakes.",
      "After the cakes have cooled, use a large serrated knife or cake leveler to slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!).",
      "Prepare the syrup: Drain the cherries, reserving 3/4 cup (180ml) of the heavy syrup. Set cherries aside. Simmer syrup and cherry liquor in a small saucepan over low heat until reduced down to 1/4 cup (60ml). Brush reduced syrup all over the cakes, reserving any leftover syrup.",
      "Slice the cherries in half, leaving a few whole cherries for garnish. Set aside.",
      "Make the ganache: Place chopped chocolate and corn syrup, if using, in a medium bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until it begins to gently simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil\u2013 that\u2019s too hot!) Pour over chocolate and let it sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften the chocolate. Slowly stir until completely combined and chocolate has melted. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes as you prepare the whipped cream.",
      "Make the whipped cream: Using a KitchenAid stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes.",
      "Assemble the cake: Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Spread 1 heaping cup of whipped cream evenly on top. Dot with half of the halved cherries and drizzle with a spoonful of reduced syrup. Top with 2nd cake layer and evenly cover the top with 1 heaping cup whipped cream, the remaining halved cherries, and another drizzle of reduced syrup. Top with the 3rd cake layer. Spread the remaining whipped cream on top and all around the sides in a thin layer using an icing spatula. Use a bench scraper to smooth out the whipped cream on the sides of the cake.",

      "Cover and store leftover cake at room temperature for 1 day or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions:\u00a0The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. For the cherry syrup, cool then cover and refrigerate overnight. The whipped cream can be prepared, covered tightly, and refrigerated overnight. Chocolate ganache can be prepared, covered tightly, and refrigerated for up to 3 days before using. Let ganache sit at room temperature to soften or microwave for 5-10 seconds before using. The assembled cake can be refrigerated for up to 1 day before slicing and serving. The frosted cake can also be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving.",
      "Why Room Temperature Ingredients? All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly. Read more about the importance of room temperature ingredients. Instead of sour cream, try using plain yogurt. The cake won\u2019t taste as rich, but it\u2019s a fine substitution.",
      "Cocoa Powder: Use natural cocoa in the cake, not dutch-process. Here\u2019s the difference between dutch-process vs. natural cocoa powder.",
      "Espresso Powder: Espresso powder and coffee will not make the chocolate taste like coffee. Rather, they deepen the chocolate flavor. I highly recommend them both. If coffee isn\u2019t your thing, you can leave out the espresso powder and use boiling hot water instead of the hot coffee.",
      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk is required for this recipe. You can make your own DIY version of buttermilk if needed. Add 1 teaspoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1/2 cup. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe.",
      "Cherries: Canned dark sweet cherries in heavy syrup (they are sold as such) are imperative to the recipe. The syrup will be reduced down. Do not use fresh dark sweet cherries, sour cherries, or maraschino cherries.",
      "Cherry Liquor: The cherry liquor is optional, but really gives the soaking syrup (step 4) that over-the-top delicious flavor setting this black forest cake apart from others. You can also add a splash to the whipped cream!",
      "Corn Syrup: I like to add a touch of light corn syrup to the ganache to give it some glistening shine. This is an optional ingredient."

      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease\u00a0three 6-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)",
      "Make the vanilla batter: Whisk the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed. On medium-high speed, beat in the eggs, sour cream, and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed.",
      "With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients, and mixing each addition just until incorporated. Do not overmix this batter. The batter will be smooth, velvety, and slightly thick.",
      "Make the chocolate batter: There will be around 4 cups of batter total. Transfer half of it to another bowl. Whisk in the 3 chocolate batter ingredients until combined. A few small lumps are ok.",
      "Watch the video in the original zebra cake recipe to see exactly how to layer the batters into the cake pans. Drop a large spoonful of 1 batter in the center of the pan. Top with a spoonful of the other batter. Alternate spoonfuls on top of each other. Give the pan a shake to level it all out. Repeat with each cake pan until all the batter is used.",
      "Bake for around 19-22 minutes or until the cakes are baked through.\u00a0To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Make the frosting: Using a blender or food processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a powdery\u00a0crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup. Set aside.\u00a0In a large\u00a0bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, cream, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Taste.\u00a0Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Set 1 heaping cup of frosting aside; this will be the vanilla frosting for the inside the cake. Beat the strawberry powder into the remaining frosting until combined.",
      "Assemble and frost:\u00a0First, using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard or crumble and use as cake garnish or enjoy over ice cream! Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with 1/2 of the vanilla frosting. Top with 2nd layer and evenly cover the top with the rest of the vanilla frosting. Top with the third cake layer. Spread the strawberry frosting into a thick layer all over the top and sides. Garnish with sprinkles, if desired. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake keep its shape when cutting.",
      "Cover leftover cake\u00a0tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions:\u00a0The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight or frozen up to 3 months. The frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Let the frosting sit at room temperature to slightly soften for 10 minutes before using. Frosted cake can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving.",

      "Flour: Sift flour before measuring.",
      "Buttermilk: You can make your own DIY version of buttermilk if needed. Add 1 teaspoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 3/4 cup. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe.",
      "Why is Everything at Room Temperature? All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly. Read more about the importance of room temperature ingredients.\u00a0",
      "Where to Buy Freeze-Dried Strawberries? I always find them in my regular grocery store in the dried fruit aisle. Wegmans, Giant, Trader Joe\u2019s and Target carries them. Keep your eyes peeled\u2014they\u2019re more commonly found that you think! Do not use the chewy/gummy dried strawberries. You need FREEZE-dried strawberries which grind into a powder. If you can\u2019t find them anywhere, just leave them out of the frosting and add another 1/2 cup of confectioners\u2019 sugar."

Combine the butter, chocolate, granulated sugar, heavy cream, and corn syrup together in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir constantly until butter has melted. Once melted, stir occasionally as the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil. Allow to boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Taste (it\u2019s warm, so be careful!) Add a sprinkle of salt, if desired. I always add a pinch. Leave uncovered and set aside to thicken and cool for at least 1-2 hours or until it has a spreadable consistency. This is enough time to bake and cool the cake layers. See make ahead tip if you want to prepare ahead of time. Yields about 2 and 1/4 cups icing.",

Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans; they may crack and crumble otherwise. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post. You can also reuse the parchment for each of the 9 cakes or cut 9 individual circles.)",
      "Make the cake: Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. On medium-high speed, add 1 egg at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.",
      "With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients, and mixing each addition just until incorporated. Do not overmix this batter. The batter will be smooth, velvety, and slightly thick.",
      "(There are 8 cups of batter total, so each of the 9 cakes will have slightly less than 1 cup of batter. Leave unused batter loosely covered at room temperature as cakes bake.) Pour slightly less than 1 cup of batter into prepared cake pans. Bake for 12 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. The cakes are VERY thin, so they shouldn\u2019t take much longer than that. Allow to cool for a couple minutes, then carefully invert the cake onto the counter. Peel off the parchment to reuse (or use a new parchment round). Grease the warm cake pans, line with parchment, and grease the parchment. Repeat with slightly less than 1 cup of batter per cake pan. Repeat baking, cooling, and releasing the cakes from the warm pans.\u00a0Grease the warm cake pans, line with parchment, and grease the parchment. Repeat one final time.

      "9 Layers: The 9 cake layers are baked individually instead of baking 3 or 4 thick cakes and slicing them horizontally to create layers. Baking each cake layer individually doesn\u2019t take any longer since the thinner cakes take less time in the oven, about 12 minutes each. Baking 3 at a time, they\u2019ll be done in less than 40 minutes. This method also ensures that each layer is baked evenly. Baking 3 thicker cakes risks over or under-baking and the cakes are more likely to sink in the centers because they\u2019re so thick. If you have more than 3 9-inch cake pans, bake more cakes at once. I baked 4 cakes 2x then 1 cake by itself. If you have fewer than 3 9-inch cake pans, simply bake in batches until all 9 cakes are baked.",
      "Icing: For a sweeter icing, use semi-sweet chocolate. For dark chocolate icing, use bittersweet chocolate. For very dark chocolate icing, use unsweetened chocolate. I prefer bittersweet chocolate.",
      "Flour: Sift flour before measuring.",
      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk (an acid) is required for this cake recipe. If you don\u2019t have any, you can make a DIY sour milk substitute. Add 1 Tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1 and 3/4 cups. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe."

    "ingredients": [
      "1 and 3/4 cups (207g) cake flour (spooned & leveled)",
      "3/4 teaspoon baking powder",
      "1/4 teaspoon baking soda",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt",
      "1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",

      "1/2 cup (120ml)\u00a0whole milk, at room temperature",
      "1/2 cup rainbow sprinkles",
      "1 and 1/2 cups (3 sticks; 345g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
      "6 cups (720g) confectioners\u2019 sugar",
      "1/3 cup (80ml) heavy cream or whole milk",

      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease three 6-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)",
      "Make the cake:\u00a0Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.\u00a0Beat in the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes, then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed.\u00a0With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients just until combined. With the mixer still running on low, pour in the milk and mix just until combined. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. Gently fold in the sprinkles. The batter will be slightly thick.",
      "Pour batter evenly into cake pans.\u00a0Bake for around 18-21 minutes or until the cakes are baked through.\u00a0To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it\u2019s done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Make the frosting:\u00a0In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, heavy cream, vanilla extract, and salt with the mixer running on low. Increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes. Add more confectioners\u2019\u00a0sugar if frosting is too thin, more cream\u00a0if frosting is too thick, or a pinch more of salt if frosting is too sweet.",
      "Assemble and decorate: Using a large serrated knife,\u00a0slice\u00a0a thin layer off the tops of the cakes\u00a0to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!).\u00a0Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate.\u00a0Evenly cover the top with about 3/4 cup of frosting. Top with 2nd cake layer and\u00a0evenly cover the top with about 3/4 cup of frosting. Top with the third cake layer.\u00a0Spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides or, to replicate the decoration in the pictures and video,\u00a0follow my directions in the recipe notes below. Refrigerate for at least 30-45 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.",
      "Cover leftover cake\u00a0tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions:\u00a0The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Let the frosting sit at room temperature to slightly soften for 10 minutes before assembling and frosting. Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving.",

      "Cake Flour: Sift cake flour before measuring.\u00a0If you can\u2019t get your hands on cake flour, you can make this homemade cake flour substitute. I suggest doing this 2x, then remove 1/4 cup since you need 1 and 3/4 cups in this recipe.",
      "Milk: Whole milk and full-fat sour cream are strongly recommended for the best taste and texture. A full-fat plain yogurt would work instead, though the cake may not be as light. Same goes with a lower fat milk.",
      "Why is Everything at Room Temperature? All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly. Read more about the importance of room temperature ingredients.\u00a0",
      "Sprinkles: Avoid using nonpareils (the little balls) as they bleed their color into the cake batter. I used these pastel confetti quins.",
      "Buttercream: This yields a lot of frosting. If looking to decorate the cake without the floral detail, follow these white cake ratios for vanilla buttercream.",
      "To Decorate Exactly as Pictured: Once cake has been assembled with frosting between the layers, spread a thin layer of frosting, called a crumb coat, all over the top and sides. I recommend a bench scraper to smooth the sides and top. Divide the remaining frosting into 4 bowls. Tint frosting your desired colors. I used mauve and dusty pink from this gel food coloring kit and a very tiny drop of sky blue from this gel food coloring kit. I kept the rest of the frosting white. Grab 3 piping bags.\u00a0Fit piping bags with star piping tips. I used two Wilton 1M star piping tips\u00a0(2D piping tip\u00a0is similar) and one Ateco 844 star piping tip. Add spoonfuls of two different colored frostings to each piping bag, alternating colors. Your piping bag will be marbled with different colors. (Note: I kept one piping bag only the mauve color.) Twist the open end of the piping bag shut and squeeze\u00a0the frosting\u00a0down to the tip.\u00a0Squeeze some frosting onto a plate until you begin to see more than 1 color. Pipe swirls, roses, and hydrangea-looking flowers all over the cake, starting at the bottom and working your way up. You can watch me decorate my cake in the helpful video above.",

Add flour and whisk until combined. Mixture will be thick. Whisk about 1/2 cup half-and-half into yolk mixture to temper, then slowly whisk tempered yolk mixture into half-and-half in the saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, whisking constantly, for 5 minutes as the mixture thickens. (America\u2019s Test Kitchen instructs for 7-8 minutes, but mine began thickening quickly.)",
      "Increase heat to medium and cook, whisking vigorously, until bubbles burst on the surface, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk in the butter and vanilla extract until combined. Pastry cream will be thick. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl. Press plastic wrap directly on surface of pastry cream and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.",

Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)",
      "Make the cake: Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. In the microwave or on the stove, heat milk and butter together until butter has melted. Stir in the vanilla extract. Cover loosely to keep warm.\u00a0In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the eggs and granulated sugar together on high speed until light and creamy, about 4 minutes. Add hot milk mixture and whisk by hand until combined, then whisk in the dry ingredients. Batter will bubbly on top and somewhat thick, similar to pancake batter.",

      "Remove cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack.\u00a0Allow to cool completely in the pan. As the cakes cool, check the pastry cream in the refrigerator. If it\u2019s too thick, it won\u2019t easily spread and could tear the cake. I remove pastry cream from the refrigerator about 20 minutes before assembling the cake.",
      "Assemble the cake:\u00a0 Once cakes are cool, run a thin knife around the edges to release them from the pans. Place bottom cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Spread pastry cream evenly on top. Place second cake layer on top and gently press down to adhere to the pastry cream. Refrigerate cake while preparing the chocolate glaze.",
      "Make the glaze: Heat heavy cream and corn syrup in a small saucepan over medium heat until just simmering. As it heats up, place chocolate in a heat-proof glass bowl with a pouring spout (I use this 2-cup liquid measuring cup). Once simmering, remove cream from heat and pour over chocolate. Let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Gently whisk until smooth.",

However, the entire assembled cake with chocolate glaze on top can be stored for up to 24 hours. See step 10. Pastry cream can weep and break if frozen, so I do not suggest freezing this cake. You can, however, freeze the baked and cooled cake layers for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight before using.",

      "Substitutions: Each ingredient is crucial to the finished cake. I do not recommend substitutions, though you can get away with using the same amount of whole milk instead of half-and-half in the pastry cream. This may be more convenient since whole milk is used for the sponge cake.",
      "Egg Whites: Lots of leftover egg whites! Make a scramble or use some in any of these recipes.",

Top with an even layer of fresh berries, then half of the lemon cheesecake mixture. Repeat. Finish with final layer of lemon pound cake cubes followed by a final layer of berries. Spread or pipe remaining whipped cream on top of the trifle. I used Wilton 1M piping tip to pipe the whipped cream on top.",

If you wish to refrigerate for longer than 6 hours, I suggest making the whipped cream in two parts. To do so, only prepare half of it in step 2 (simply halve all the ingredients). Use this for folding into the lemon cheesecake layer in step 3. Prepare and assemble the trifle, then cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.

Instead of sour cream, try using plain yogurt. The cake won\u2019t taste as rich, but it\u2019s a fine substitution.",
      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk is required for this recipe. You can make your own DIY version of buttermilk if needed. Add 1 teaspoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1/2 cup. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe.",
      "Espresso Powder / Coffee: Espresso powder and coffee will not make the chocolate taste like coffee. Rather, they deepen the chocolate flavor. I highly recommend them both. If coffee isn\u2019t your thing, you can leave out the espresso powder and use boiling hot water instead of the hot coffee.",
      "Pecans: Toasting the pecans is a major upgrade and I highly suggest it! Let them toast in the oven as you whisk together the filling on the stove (step 5). Simply toast for 8 minutes at\u00a0300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C). Then can be warm when stirred into the filling.",
      "Eggs: If you\u2019re concerned about consuming any raw egg yolks, use a candy/oil thermometer and make sure the mixture is cooked to 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C). If you notice any cooked egg bits, you can run it through a strainer.",
      "9\u00d713 Cake: You can bake this cake as a 9\u00d713 sheet cake instead. Top with coconut pecan filling, no need for the chocolate buttercream! The cake will take 35-40 minutes at\u00a0350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).",
      "Cupcakes: Use this coconut pecan filling to fill a batch of baked and cooled super moist chocolate cupcakes. Half of the filling should be plenty, so you can halve the filling recipe or make the full filling recipe and freeze leftovers for up to 3 months. You can frost with chocolate buttercream. For filling baked cupcakes, we usually cut a hole in the center and add the filling. If needed for a visual, you can watch me do this in the video for these sugar plum fairy cupcakes."

Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. On medium-high speed, add 1 egg at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.",

      "There is about 8 cups of batter total, so each layer will be 2 and 2/3 cups. Pour/spread batter evenly into prepared cake pans. If you\u2019re worried about uneven cake layers, you can use a kitchen scale and weigh the cake pans for accuracy. (The weight of just the batter in my cake pans was about 1 lb 6 ounces.)",

Add 5 and 1/2 cups confectioners\u2019 sugar, 5 Tablespoons heavy cream, the vanilla extract, and salt with the mixer running on low. Increase to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes. Add 1/2 cup more confectioners\u2019\u00a0sugar if frosting is too thin, 1 more Tablespoon cream\u00a0if frosting is too thick, or a pinch more of salt if frosting is way too sweet. Yields about 4.5 cups of frosting.",

You can sprinkle a few leftover raspberries in the center, too. (Like I did in the video.) Top with the third cake layer. Spread the remaining frosting on top and all around the sides using an icing spatula. Use a bench scraper to smooth out the frosting on the sides of the cake. If you\u2019re making a full naked cake, just spread the remaining frosting on top of the cake.

My full tempering tutorial is in Sally\u2019s Candy Addiction if you have a copy.",
      "Cake Balls: Want to skip the lollipop stick? Go for it. Just dip the cake balls in melted or tempered chocolate to make delicious chocolate cake truffles.\u00a0Whenever I dip truffles, I always use this spiral dipping tool.\u00a0Place the truffle in the chocolate and lift it out with the dipping tool. Quickly flip it upside down on a lined baking sheet. You can see exactly how I do this in this video (scroll down for video): dark chocolate chocolate rum truffles. Go to the 1 minute mark. That\u2019s how I dip and neatly release truffles. So easy!"

      "White Chocolate: White chocolate bars are typically sold in 4 ounce bars. I suggest Ghirardelli, Baker\u2019s brand, or Lindt. They are found next to the chocolate chips in the baking aisle. Finely chop the white chocolate so it melts easier and quicker.",
      "Cocoa Powder: Use natural cocoa in the cake, not dutch-process. There is no leavening occurring in the frosting, so you can use 3/4 cup of either. In the pictured frosting, I used some natural unsweetened cocoa (1/4 cup) and some Hershey\u2019s special dark cocoa (1/2 cup). Yum!",
      "Corn Syrup: Corn syrup or honey is what gives the frosting its silky texture and pretty shine."

Decorate the top with sprinkles and place upright into a styrofoam block or box (as explained above). Repeat with remaining cake balls, only working with a few out of the refrigerator at a time. The cake balls must be very cold when dipping!",

Semi-sweet, dark, bittersweet, or milk chocolate baking bars work, too. Coarsely chop the chocolate and place it in a microwave-safe bowl or glass liquid measuring cup, along with 1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil to help thin it out.

      "Read the instructions through before beginning. Make sure you are prepared for step 7 immediately when that cake comes out!",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Spray\u00a0a\u00a010\u00d715-inch baking pan\u00a0with nonstick spray or grease with butter, so the parchment paper sticks. Then line it with parchment paper so the cake seamlessly releases in step 5. Spray or grease the parchment paper too. We want an extremely nonstick surface for this cake roll.",
      "Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and salt together. Set aside.",
      "Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with whisk\u00a0attachment, beat the egg whites and 1/4 cup sugar together on high speed for 4-5 minutes or until stiff peaks form. Transfer to another bowl. Using the same mixing bowl you just had the egg whites in (no need to clean it), add the egg yolks, remaining sugar, buttermilk, vanilla extract, and vanilla bean. Beat together on high speed for 3-4 minutes or until light in color.",
      "Add half of the whipped egg whites into the egg yolk mixture. Beat on low speed for 10 seconds. Repeat with remaining egg whites and beat on low for 10 seconds. Finally, add the flour mixture and beat on low until the batter is completely combined. Do not overmix.",
      "Spread batter evenly into prepared pan. Give the pan a shake to make sure the batter is level and reaches the corners.\u00a0Bake for 15 minutes or until the cake springs back when you poke it with a finger.",
      "As the cake bakes, lay a thin kitchen\u00a0towel flat\u00a0on the counter. Sprinkle with 1 cup of confectioners\u2019 sugar. Once the cake comes out of the oven, immediately invert it onto the towel. Peel off the parchment paper then, starting with the narrow end, begin rolling the cake up with the towel. Do this slowly and gently. The cake will be warm as it just came out of the oven.",
      "Allow the cake to cool completely rolled up in the towel. I stick mine in the refrigerator for about 2 hours to speed it up.",
      "Remove the cake roll from the refrigerator and allow to sit on the counter for a few minutes to warm up as you prepare the frosting.",
      "Using a blender or food processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a powdery\u00a0crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup. Set aside.\u00a0In a large bowl using a hand-held or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese\u00a0for 1 minute on high speed until completely smooth and creamy. Beat in the butter until combined. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, strawberry powder, and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy. Taste, then add a pinch of salt if needed.",
      "Gently and slowly unroll the cake. Flatten it out and spread frosting evenly on top, leaving about a 1/2 inch border around the cake. Gently and slowly roll the cake back up, without the towel this time. Make sure you\u2019re rolling it tightly. Some frosting may spill out the sides, that\u2019s ok!\u00a0Loosely cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 20 minutes before slicing and serving. Dust with more confectioners\u2019 sugar and garnish with some sliced strawberries, if desired."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: You can prepare the cake through step 7\u00a0and chill the rolled up cake/towel in the refrigerator for up to 1 day before continuing with step 8. Prepared cake roll, with frosting, freezes well for up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before slicing and serving.",

      "Cake Flour: I strongly suggest using cake flour in this recipe. It\u2019s sold right next to the all-purpose flour in the baking aisle. And you use it a lot in my recipes! In a pinch, you can use this homemade cake flour substitute.",
      "Buttermilk: I strongly recommend buttermilk for flavor, but you can use whole milk in a pinch. For best taste and texture, I don\u2019t recommend lower fat or nondairy milk.",
      "Vanilla Beans: If you can\u2019t get your hands on vanilla beans and have a jar of vanilla bean paste, use 1/4 teaspoon in its place. If you have neither, just skip it. 2 teaspoons of *pure* vanilla extract is just fine.",
      "Freeze-Dried Strawberries: I can usually find freeze-dried strawberries at Target, Trader Joes, Walmart, and my regular grocery stores (Giant and Wegmans). If you\u2019re still having trouble finding them, try this delicious strawberry whipped cream as the filling. I suggest\u00a0making a little more, so using 2 cups heavy cream + 1/4 cup granulated sugar + 2 tsp vanilla + 3/4 cup of the strawberry filling."

      "Pineapple: Slightly drain the crushed pineapple. You want a little juice, but not all of it!",
      "Frozen Bananas:\u00a0You can use thawed frozen bananas in this recipe. Thawed bananas are extra wet, so drain off as much of the excess liquid as you can before mashing. See\u00a0How to Freeze & Thaw Bananas for Baking.",
      "Cupcakes: This recipe will make at least 32-35 cupcakes. Fill liners 2/3 full and bake 20-22 minutes or until cooked through. You can halve the recipe for less cupcakes, but things get tricky with the eggs. I recommend using 1 egg plus this: crack a 2nd egg in a separate bowl, whisk it, and use about half.",

      "Room Temperature Ingredients: All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly. Here\u2019s more on the importance of room temperature ingredients. Instead of sour cream, try using plain yogurt. The cake won\u2019t taste as rich, but it\u2019s a fine substitute.",
      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk is required for this recipe. You can make your own DIY version of buttermilk if needed. Add 1 teaspoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1/2 cup. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe.",
      "Hot Water: Instead of boiling water, try using hot and strong black coffee. The cake won\u2019t taste like coffee, but the chocolate flavor will definitely be accentuated. I reduced the amount down from 1/2 cup (120ml) to 1/3 cup (80ml) to yield a thicker cake batter which helps support the cream cheese layer.",

      "30 regular Oreos (not Double-Stuf)",
      "1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, melted",
      "1 quart chocolate ice cream, softened",
      "1 quart your choice flavor ice cream, softened (I used peanut butter cup)",
      "1 and 1/2 cups (420g) hot fudge (store-bought or yummy homemade)",
      "1 cup (240ml) heavy cream",
      "2 Tablespoons (15g) confectioners\u2019 sugar",
      "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "sprinkles"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Make the crust:\u00a0In a food processor or blender, pulse 30 Oreos (including the cream filling) into a fine crumb. You should have about 3 cups crumbs, or 330g. Pour crumbs into a large bowl. Add the melted butter and stir to combine. The mixture will be thick and quite wet. Try to smash/break up any large chunks. Pour the mixture into an ungreased 9\u00d713-inch pan. With medium pressure using your hand, pat the crumbs down into the bottom to make a compact, thick crust. Freeze for 15 minutes.",
      "During that time, place the softened chocolate ice cream in a bowl and give it a good stir to rid any frozen lumps. You want a nice smooth, soft ice cream. Spread it on top of the frozen crust. Freeze for 15\u201330 minutes. (Closer to 30 minutes is ideal.)",
      "During that time, place the 2nd ice cream flavor into a bowl and stir it until it is smooth and very soft. Carefully spread on top of the chocolate ice cream. Freeze for 15\u201330 minutes. (Closer to 30 minutes is ideal.)",
      "Make sure the hot fudge is spreadable consistency. You may have to slightly heat it if using store-bought. Spread it on top of the ice cream as best you can. Because it is not as cold as the ice cream layer, the two will slightly mix together as you spread. That\u2019s ok. Freeze for 15\u201330 minutes. (Closer to 30 minutes is ideal.)",
      "Make the whipped cream:\u00a0Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream, confectioners\u2019 sugar, and vanilla on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 4\u20135 minutes. Spread on top of hot fudge layer, then top with sprinkles. Cover with aluminum foil and freeze for at least 12 hours before serving (and up to a few days).",
      "Use a very sharp knife to cut, making sure you are cutting into the crust. Keep leftovers in the freezer."

    "ingredients": [
      "6 ounces (170g) high quality semi-sweet chocolate, such as Ghirardelli or Lindt",
      "1/2 cup (115g; 1 stick) unsalted butter",
      "1/4 cup (31g) all-purpose flour\u00a0(spooned & leveled)",
      "1/2 cup (60g) confectioners\u2019 sugar",
      "1/8 teaspoon salt",
      "2 large eggs",
      "2 large egg yolks",
      "8 teaspoons (42g) creamy peanut butter (about 2 teaspoons per cake)*",
      "optional for serving: ice cream, melted peanut butter and/or chocolate syrup for drizzling"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Spray each ramekin with nonstick cooking spray\u00a0and dust with cocoa powder. This ensures the cakes will seamlessly come out of the ramekins when inverted onto a plate in step 6.",
      "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (218\u00b0C).",
      "Coarsely chop the chocolate. Place butter into a medium heat-proof bowl, then add chopped chocolate on top. Microwave on high in 10 second increments, stirring after each until completely smooth. Set aside.",
      "Whisk the flour, confectioners\u2019 sugar, and salt together in a small bowl. Whisk the eggs and egg yolks together until combined in another small bowl. Pour the flour mixture and eggs into the bowl of chocolate. Slowly stir everything together using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. If there are any lumps, gently use your whisk to rid them. The batter\u00a0will be slightly thick.",
      "Spoon chocolate batter evenly into each prepared ramekin. Top with peanut butter and use a spoon to slightly press it down into the batter. Some may still be exposed\u2013 see photo above for a visual.",
      "Place ramekins onto a baking sheet and bake for 12-13 minutes until the sides appear solid and firm. The top may still look slightly soft. Allow to cool for 1 minute, then cover each with an inverted plate and turn over. Use an oven mitt because those ramekins are hot! The cakes should release easily from the ramekin. Top with ice cream and melted peanut butter and/or chocolate syrup for serving, if desired. Serve immediately."

      "Peanut Butter: Do not use natural style peanut butter, do not use crunchy peanut butter, do not use any other nut butter like almond butter. The best for this recipe is commercial brand peanut butter like creamy Jif or Skippy. I use Jif creamy.",
      "Plain Lava Cakes: I\u2019ve gotten some questions about making these plain, without peanut butter. Yes, it\u2019s possible! No changes necessary, just don\u2019t add the peanut butter and bake for only about 12-13 minutes.",
      "Ramekins: I like these 6 ounce oven-proof custard cups\u00a0or these 6 ounce ramekins). I\u2019m unsure about the bake time for ramekins any other size than 6 ounces. I highly suggest just buying the specified size if you do not own them already.\u00a0The good news: this standard size is typical\u00a0for other dessert recipes like\u00a0custards, souffl\u00e9s, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9es, chocolate fudge cakes, and mousse.",

Add the brown sugar and beat on high speed for 1\u00a0minute until creamed together fairly well.\u00a0Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.

Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.\u00a0With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the hot water/molasses, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients, and mixing each addition just until incorporated. Avoid overmixing.\u00a0Batter will be thin. Whisk out any big lumps.",
      "Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake\u00a0for around 35 minutes or until the cake is\u00a0baked through. All ovens are different and your cake could take a little more or less time. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean with only a couple moist (not wet) crumbs, it is done. Allow cake to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack. The cake must be completely cool before frosting.",

Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, milk, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 20 seconds then increase to high speed until everything is completely combined and the frosting is creamy. Taste. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Spread on top of cake. Spread around the sides if you have extra frosting.",
      "Slice, serve, enjoy! Leftover frosted cake keeps well covered tightly in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. The flavor gets even better after a day or two."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: The cake can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Assemble and frost the cake the next day when you are ready to serve. Frosted or unfrosted cake can be frozen up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving. Honestly, it tastes much better fresh!",
      "Different Size Pans: No matter what size pan you use, bake the cake at 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). A 9-inch springform pan or 10-inch springform pan is best because this gingerbread cake rises pretty high. 9-inch cake pans are too short. You can also use a 9-inch square pan or 11\u00d77-inch rectangle pan. The bake times will all be relatively 35 minutes. Use a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake to test for doneness. If it comes out clean, the cake is done. There is not enough batter for a 9\u00d713-inch cake pan or a bundt pan.",
      "Cupcakes: For cupcakes, fill liners halfway and bake for 20-22 minutes.",
      "Layer Cake: I suggest making the batter twice. (Don\u2019t double it\u2014make it twice and combine the batters.) This will be a lot of batter and is the perfect amount for a 3 layer cake. Grease three 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. Fill the cake pans halfway. Use any leftover batter for cupcakes. OR you can make the cake as is and slice in half to turn into a thinner 2 layer cake.",

    "instructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease and lightly flour 4 9-inch round cake pans*, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)",
      "Make the cake: Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed for 5 full minutes until creamed together fairly well. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. On medium-high speed, add 1 whole egg at a time, beating well after each addition until all 3 whole eggs are mixed in. Then, repeat with each egg yolk until all 4 egg yolks are mixed in. Beat in the vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.",
      "With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in three additions alternating with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients, and mixing each addition just until incorporated. Do not overmix this batter. The batter will be smooth, velvety, and slightly thick.\u00a0Spoon/pour batter evenly into each cake pan.",
      "Bake for around 25 minutes or until the cakes are baked through.\u00a0To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Make the frosting: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until pale, smooth, and creamy, about 2 minutes. Using a fine mesh strainer or sieve, sift the confectioners\u2019 sugar and cocoa together. Add the sugar/cocoa mixture to the butter, then beat on low speed for 20 seconds. Stop the mixer, then add the milk, corn syrup, vanilla, and salt. Beat on medium-high speed for 2 minutes. If the frosting is too thick, beat in an extra splash of milk.",
      "Assemble the cake:\u00a0Grab a 3 and 1/2 \u2013 4 inch circle cookie cutter (I use a large thin-edged cup) and cut a hole into two of the cake layers. Alternatively, you can cut a piece of parchment paper that size and use a sharp knife to trace/cut the holes. Place one of the whole cakes on a cake turntable, cake stand or serving plate. Use an offset spatula or knife to frost the top of the cake, then place one of the cut/holed cakes on top. Frost the top and inside the cavity. Place the other cut/holed cake on top and, once again, frost the top and inside the cavity. Fill the cavity with candies all the way up to the top. Place the last whole cake on top and frost the top and sides of the entire cake. Decorate with frosting and additional candies however you\u2019d like. I used a Wilton 1M tip to pipe frosting around the top.",
      "Slice, serve, enjoy! (Keep a spoon handy when serving. I like to pile additional candies that fall out of the center\u00a0of the pi\u00f1ata cake onto each slice as I serve.)"
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Assemble and frost the pi\u00f1ata cake the next day when you are ready to serve. Frosted cake can be frozen up to 2 months if you have room in the freezer. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving. Honestly, it tastes much better fresh",

      "Flour: Make sure you sift the flour before measuring. Sifting is KEY. Otherwise, your cake layers could taste much too dense. You can also use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. Use 4 cups sifted cake flour.",
      "Buttermilk:\u00a0If you don\u2019t have buttermilk, you can make a DIY sour milk substitute. Add 1 Tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1 and 1/2 cups. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe.",
      "Corn Syrup: This tiny bit of corn syrup makes the frosting uniquely glossy and shiny. You can leave it out if you\u2019d like.",

Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy. Add more confectioners\u2019 sugar if frosting is too thin, a little milk if frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Frosting should be soft, but not runny.",
      "Assemble and frost:\u00a0First, using a large serrated knife or cake leveler, layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Place 1 cake layer on your cake turntable, cake stand, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer, more frosting, and then top with the 3rd layer. Spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. Decorate the sides and top of the cake with the remaining toasted pecans. Refrigerate cake for at least 15-20 minutes before slicing.

      "Applesauce: Instead of applesauce, you can use 3/4 cup crushed pineapple if desired. Slightly drain the canned crushed pineapple first. You want it the consistency of applesauce\u2013 not too watery. You could also use 3/4 cup mashed bananas, sour cream, plain yogurt, or canned pumpkin puree.",
      "Carrots:\u00a0My #1 tip for carrot cakes is to grate whole carrots at home. Do not use packaged pre-shredded carrots because they are hard and dry.",
      "Oil: If using melted coconut oil, make sure all of the other cake batter ingredients (carrots included) are room temperature. Otherwise, the melted coconut oil will begin to solidify before the batter goes into the oven.",
      "Cream Cheese: Use bricks of real cream cheese. Not cream cheese spread.",

      "Carrot Bundt Cake: Use a 10-12 cup generously greased Bundt pan. Bake for 55-75 minutes. All ovens and bundt pans are different, so that\u2019s why the bake time varies. Keep a close eye on it.",
      "Add-Ins: If you\u2019d like to add raisins or coconut, reduce the pecans (or leave them out) to 1/2 cup. Then, add 1 cup of raisins or shredded coconut. Stick to around 1 \u2013 1.5 cups total add-ins. Or you can leave the cake plain without any add-ins.",

      "Preheat oven to\u00a0350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).\u00a0Generously grease and lightly flour a 12\u00d717 inch half sheet/jelly roll pan. Set aside.",
      "In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the softened butter for about 1 minute on medium speed. Get it nice and smooth, then add the sugar on medium speed and beat until fluffy and light in color. Beat in eggs\u00a0and vanilla until smooth. You\u2019ll need to stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl\u00a0to get it all mixed a couple times. Beat in the yogurt on medium high speed until combined.",
      "In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt together. Pour half of this flour mixture into the creamed butter mixture. Beat on low speed for 5 seconds. Pour in half of the milk. Beat on low speed for 5 seconds. Repeat with the rest of the flour and beat in the remainder of the milk until combined and smooth. Do not overmix. Fold in the sprinkles.",
      "Spread the cake batter into the prepared pan. Smooth it out into a thin, even layer. Bake for 20-24 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Make sure you rotate the cake pan once or twice during bake time if your oven has hot spots (mine does). Remove from the oven and allow the cake to cool in the pan on a wire rack. As the cake is cooling, make the frosting.",
      "For the frosting:\u00a0Using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy \u2013 about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, milk, vanilla extract, and salt with the mixer running on low. Increase to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes. Add more confectioners\u2019\u00a0sugar if frosting is too thin, more milk if frosting is too thick, or a pinch more of salt if frosting is way too sweet.",
      "Spread frosting all over cooled cake, then top with sprinkles. Slice and serve.\u00a0Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: Cake can be made 1 day in advance, covered tightly at room temperature, and then frosted before serving. Frosting can also be made 1 day ahead of time\u2013 cover tightly and keep in the refrigerator.",
      "Yogurt: Plain Greek yogurt, regular plain yogurt, or sour cream are all OK. Do not use nonfat; I suggest full fat or low fat.",
      "Milk: I highly recommend whole milk for the richest taste and moistest texture. 1% or higher milk fat is ok, as well as nondairy (low fat, not nonfat) milks. Whole milk (or even half-and-half or cream) is best in the frosting as well.",
      "9\u00d713 Inch Cake:\u00a0Simply pour the batter into a greased and lightly floured 9\u00d713 inch pan and bake for 35-38 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Be sure to tent the cake with foil after 20 minutes of baking to prevent over-browning on the top and sides.",
      "Sprinkles: Here is where I buy my rainbow jimmies sprinkles in bulk. Do not use nonpareils (the little ball sprinkles) inside the cake batter because they bleed color. You can, however, decorate the frosting with nonpareils like I did in these photos."

This will be tricky since the marshmallow creme is so sticky, but do the best you can to get an even layer. Sometimes I spray the bottom of a spatula with nonstick spray to spread it around. Sprinkle the marshmallow creme with chocolate chips and marshmallows. Mold the remaining cookie dough into flat pieces and layer on top of the chocolate chips. You won\u2019t have enough dough to make one single layer, so some chocolate chips and marshmallow creme will be exposed. That is ok! You want to see the marshmallow on top. Sprinkle the top of the cookie cake with a few more chocolate chips on top, if you prefer.",
      "Bake the cookie\u00a0cake\u00a0for 25 minutes, or until the top is very lightly golden brown. Allow to cool for at least 30 minutes before digging in.",
      "The cookie cake looks and tastes best on the same day. I do not suggest making this dessert ahead of time for an event because the marshmallow becomes too hard overtime. If you need to make it ahead, leave out the marshmallows. They tend to expand and then deflate underneath the dough, which isn\u2019t very pretty after several hours."

      "Make the cake: Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside. In a large bowl, melt the butter in the microwave. Vigorously whisk in the granulated sugar, then the eggs, milk, and vanilla extract. Slowly whisk the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until hardly any lumps remain. The batter will be very thick \u2013 try not to overmix. Fold in the raspberries and chocolate chips \u2013 be gentle; you don\u2019t want to break the raspberries and have them bleed into the batter.",
      "Divide batter evenly between prepared cake pans. Bake for 22-24 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the cakes with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the tops from getting too brown. Cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool completely in the pans on a wire rack.",
      "Make the frosting:\u00a0Cream the butter with a hand or stand mixer on medium speed for 3-4 minutes. This will create a nice creamy base for the frosting. Add 3 cups of confectioners\u2019 sugar\u00a0and 3/4 cup of cocoa powder. Mix on low. Add 3 Tablespoons of heavy cream and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. If your frosting is too thin, add up to 1 more cup of confectioners\u2019 sugar. If your frosting is too thick, add up to 2 more Tablespoons of heavy cream. Taste and add salt if you prefer \u2013 I usually add about 1/4 teaspoon. Add more cocoa powder if the frosting is not chocolate-y enough. (This frosting recipe is forgiving. Add more/less of each ingredient to obtain the consistency and taste you desire.)",
      "Assemble and frost:\u00a0First, using a large serrated knife, trim the tops off the cake layers to create a flat surface. Place 1 layer on your cake turntable, cake stand, or serving platter. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer, more frosting, then the third layer. Top with frosting and spread around the sides. Top with raspberries and/or chocolate chips for garnish if desired.",

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Assemble and frost the cake the next day when you are ready to serve. Frosted cake can be frozen up to 2 months if you have room in the freezer. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving. Honestly, it tastes much better fresh.",

I have used both options and they both work wonderfully. It\u2019s important to have an acidic ingredient here (the buttermilk or the yogurt/sour cream). For the whole milk + yogurt/sour cream version, you can use lower fat or nondairy milk instead of whole milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich."

      "2 cups all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)",
      "1 cup + 2 Tablespoons granulated sugar",

      "3/4 cup buttermilk, at room temperature",
      "1 large egg, at room temperature",
      "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
      "2/3 cup packed light or dark brown sugar",
      "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Generously spray a 9-inch springform pan* with cooking spray or grease with butter. Sprinkle the bottom of the pan with 1 Tablespoon of flour and tap out the excess.",
      "Whisk the flour, sugar, and salt together in a large mixing bowl until combined. Cut in the butter in very small pieces using a pastry blender or mix with a fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Place 1 cup of the butter/flour mixture in the refrigerator until ready to use in step 4.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer with a paddle attachment, mix the baking powder and baking soda into the remaining flour mixture. Add the room temperature buttermilk, egg, and vanilla and beat on medium speed until smooth. The batter is very thick. Spoon the batter into the prepared springform pan, smoothing the top.",
      "Add the brown sugar and cinnamon to the reserved flour mixture. Toss with a fork until well blended. Sprinkle the crumbs over the batter, pressingly lightly so they stick.",
      "Bake the cake until the center is firm and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45-55 minutes. Baking time varies, so begin checking at 45 minutes and don\u2019t be alarmed if your cake takes longer. Mine usually takes the full 55 minutes.",
      "Cool cake for 10 minutes before removing the sides of the springform pan. For neat slices and best flavor, cool cake completely at room temperature before serving."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Cake tastes best on day 1 or day 2. The cake may be made 1 day in advance. Store covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. Cake can be frozen up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator.",

      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk is required for this recipe. You can make your own DIY version of buttermilk if needed.\u00a0To do so, simply add 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of white vinegar or fresh lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup and enough whole or 2% milk to reach 3/4 cup. Allow mixture to sit for 5 minutes, then use in the recipe. Lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch, but the cake won\u2019t taste as rich and moist.",
      "Update: Crumbs will seep down into the cake if the crumb topping\u2019s butter is not firm enough. Make sure the butter is cold. You can even try using frozen butter and cutting that into the mixture with your pastry blender.",
