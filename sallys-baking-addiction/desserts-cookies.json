    "description": "These soft and chewy gingerbread cookie bars are so easy to make\u2014no dough chilling, no dough rolling, and no cookie cutters required! They\u2019re delicious plain, or topped with spiced cream cheese frosting. Careful not to over-bake these; they\u2019ll still feel and look quite soft on top, but the bars set as they cool.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 and 1/4 cups (281g) all-purpose flour",
      "1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda",
      "2 teaspoons ground ginger",
      "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
      "1/4 teaspoon ground allspice",
      "1/4 teaspoon ground cloves",
      "1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg",
      "small pinch of ground black pepper",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt",
      "3/4 cup (12 Tbsp; 170g) unsalted butter, melted",
      "1/2 cup (100g) packed light or dark brown sugar (I recommend dark)",
      "1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar",
      "1/3 cup\u00a0 (80ml) unsulphured or dark molasses (do not use blackstrap; I prefer Grandma\u2019s brand)",
      "1 large egg, at room temperature",
      "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "6 ounces (170g) full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room temperature",
      "2 Tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
      "1 and 1/2 cups (180g) confectioners\u2019 sugar",
      "small pinch each of ground ginger, cinnamon, & allspice",
      "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "optional for garnish: 1/4 cup (43g) sprinkles"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).\u00a0Adjust oven rack to the center rack position. Line the bottom and sides of a 9\u00d713-inch metal or glass baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to easily lift the bars out of the pan. Set aside.",
      "Whisk the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, pepper, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.",
      "In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, and molasses together until no lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and vanilla. Pour this into the flour mixture and mix together  with a large spoon or silicone spatula. Be sure to mix until no lumps of flour remain. The dough will be very thick and shiny.",
      "Transfer dough to the prepared baking pan and press/smooth into an even layer. It may not seem like enough dough, and it will be a thin layer; that\u2019s ok.",
      "Bake for 23\u201326 minutes or until the top is set, but still look quite soft, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean with a few moist (not wet) crumbs. Do not over-bake. Bars puff up in the oven, but settle as they cool.",
      "Allow the bars to cool in the pan set on a wire rack for at least 1 hour.",
      "Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, ginger, cinnamon, and allspice, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Taste. Add a pinch of salt if desired.",
      "Spread the frosting on the cooled bars. Top with sprinkles, if desired. To help set the frosting, refrigerate for 30 minutes before slicing and serving. This makes cutting easier and less messy. Use the overhanging parchment to lift the bars out of the pan, and cut into squares.",
      "Cover leftover bars tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. If you skipped the frosting, cover and store plain gingerbread cookie bars at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Allow to come to room temperature and continue with step 4. Baked and cooled cookie bars, with or without frosting, freeze well for up to 3 months. Thaw bars overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving.",

      "Can I Halve the Recipe? Yes, you can halve the recipe for an 8-inch or thinner 9-inch batch of bars. The bake time is about the same, but begin checking for doneness at 22 minutes. It can be difficult to halve an egg accurately, so I do recommend making the original 9\u00d713-inch batch, and you can freeze extras.",
      "Butter: Avoid letting the melted butter cool for too long, otherwise your dough will be crumbly instead of soft (and your cookie bars can end up cakey). As soon as it\u2019s melted, stir in the sugars and molasses as instructed in step 3.",
      "Molasses: I use and recommend unsulphured or dark molasses. (I like Grandma\u2019s brand. The kind I use is labeled \u201coriginal\u201d molasses.) Blackstrap molasses is extremely bitter and not ideal in this recipe.",
      "Cream Cheese in Frosting: Use brick cream cheese, not the spreadable kind that comes in a tub."

Bake in a 300\u00b0F (149\u00b0C) oven for 5\u20137 minutes, or until slightly darkened. Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before using in the dough in step 4.",
      "Make the dough: In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together until combined. Set aside.",
      "In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until fluffy and light in color, about 2\u20133 minutes. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract, and beat until incorporated. Add the Nutella, then beat on high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.",
      "Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, and beat on low speed until combined. Add the chopped hazelnuts and beat on low until incorporated. The cookie dough will be very thick, soft, and sticky. Cover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory for this soft cookie dough.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Place the granulated sugar in a small bowl and the confectioners\u2019 sugar in another bowl, for rolling. Set aside.",
      "Shape & fill the dough: After chilling in the refrigerator, the cookie dough will be very crumbly and that\u2019s ok. The warmth of your hands quickly makes the dough workable. Scoop dough and roll into balls, a very scant Tablespoon (17g) of dough each. Make an indent with your finger or thumb in the center of each dough ball, and pinch and mold until they resemble small \u201cbowls.\u201d Add a scant 1/2 teaspoon of Nutella into the indent of half of the dough \u201cbowls.\u201d Place the other (empty) bowl-shaped pieces of dough over the top of the Nutella-filled pieces, and gently pinch the sides together to seal. Gently roll each of the stuffed dough balls in your hands to smooth out into a nice round ball.",
      "Coat the dough balls: Roll the cookie dough ball first in the granulated sugar, then very generously in the confectioners\u2019 sugar. (Altogether, each filled and sugared dough ball should weigh about 40g.) Place the dough balls 3 inches apart on the lined baking sheets.",
      "Bake the cookies for 11\u201312 minutes or until the edges appear set and the centers still look soft.",
      "Cool cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. You\u2019ll notice the confectioners\u2019 sugar coating is quite sticky while the cookies are warm, and it may absorb into the cookie a bit. The coating may take on a yellow tint because of this. You can use a sieve to sift a little more confectioners\u2019 sugar on top once the cookies have cooled, for a fresh white coating.",

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

      "Why an extra egg yolk? You need 1 whole egg, plus 1 extra egg yolk. Why? When covering in sugar, and to obtain the crinkle look, I needed the dough to spread a bit more, and so I added an extra egg yolk. An extra egg yolk adds rich softness, too.",
      "Hazelnuts: I recommend using pre-chopped hazelnuts, but if whole hazelnuts are all you have, I strongly recommend chopping by hand rather than using a food processor. In recipe testing, using a food processor resulted in unevenly sized pieces of hazelnuts; the finer-ground hazelnuts caused the dough to become too dry. If you want to omit the nuts entirely, you will need to replace them with the same amount of mini or regular-size chocolate chips, to prevent the cookies from overspreading.",
      "Confectioners\u2019 sugar melting into cookies: Be sure to coat the dough balls in granulated sugar first, and then very heavily in confectioners\u2019 sugar. After baking, the confectioners\u2019 sugar can still melt into the cookie a bit\u2014and I find that\u2019s just because Nutella is so greasy and can absorb it. The cookies will be pretty sticky when warm because of this, and have a yellow tint. To fix this, I like to use a sieve to sift a little more confectioners\u2019 sugar on top once the cookies have cooled.",
      "If you don\u2019t want to fill these cookies: My team and I tested this. Scoop and roll balls of chilled dough, about 1.5 Tablespoons (35g) of dough each (this medium cookie scoop works well), then continue with step 7. Yield is about 36 cookies."

      "Pumpkin Pie Spice: You can find pumpkin pie spice in the baking aisle of most grocery stores or make your own\u00a0homemade pumpkin pie spice. If you don\u2019t have either and want to use individual spices, use 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice, 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, and an extra 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon. Do not leave out the 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon that is also called for in this recipe.",
      "Pumpkin: Squeeze as much of the moisture out of the pumpkin puree as you can before adding it to the cookie dough. I simply squeeze the puree with paper towels. See photo in the post for a visual. This will help produce a less cakey cookie. Less moisture is a good thing in these cookies!",
      "Chocolate Chips: Instead of icing (or in addition to!), you can add 1 heaping cup of chocolate chips to the cookie dough. Or 1 cup of chopped nuts, dried cranberries, raisins, white chocolate chips, butterscotch morsels, etc.",

    "instructions": [
      "Make the cookies: Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
      "In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, lemon extract, and lemon zest and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.",
      "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.",
      "Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick.",
      "Lightly dust one of the rolled-out dough portions with flour. Place a piece of parchment paper on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1\u20132 hours and up to 2 days.",
      "Once chilled, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line 2 or 3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it\u2019s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. I used this flower cookie cutter for the fireworks cookies. For the pictured little stars (that just have flooded icing on them), I used a small star from this set.",
      "Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd piece of dough. (Note: It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.)",
      "Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11\u201312 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheets halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating.",
      "Make the icing:\u00a0Watch the video of the icing below so you get an idea of what the final consistency should be. Pour confectioners\u2019 sugar, meringue powder, and 9 Tablespoons of water into a large bowl. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat icing ingredients together on high speed for 1.5 \u2013 2 minutes. When lifting the whisk up off the icing, the icing should drizzle down and smooth out within 5-10 seconds. If it\u2019s too thick, beat in more water 1 Tablespoon at a time. I usually need 10 Tablespoons but on particularly dry days, I use up to 12-14 Tablespoons. Keep in mind that the longer you beat the royal icing, the thicker it becomes. If your royal icing is too thin, just keep beating it to introduce more air OR you can add more sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar.",
      "Decorate the fireworks cookies: Divide the icing up into separate bowls, depending on how many colors of icing you\u2019d like. Stir in gel food coloring, and then spoon the icings into piping bags fitted with piping tip #2 or piping tip #3. Pipe curved lines from the middle of the cookie to the edges. (I make the \u201cmiddle\u201d a little more off center to look more like a firework, see photos.) If you want to add sprinkles like the pictured cookies, I piped every other line, dipped the cookie (with wet icing) into sparkling sugar sprinkles, and then piped the rest of the lines. You can also add little star sprinkles to the fireworks cookies, and I used the stars from this sprinkle mix. Pipe a little dot of icing, then adhere the star sprinkle to it.",
      "Decorate the plain star cookies: For the pictured plain star-shaped cookies, I suggest\u00a0Wilton piping tip #3 or Wilton piping tip #4. Pipe a border around the cookies and then flood the center with icing. Feel free to dip into sprinkles.",
      "Icing completely dries in about 2 hours at room temperature. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it\u2019s helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you can place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help speed up the icing setting.",
      "Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending. Plain or decorated cookies stay soft for about 5 days when covered tightly at room temperature. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 3, divide in half, flatten both halves into discs as we do with pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the discs in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4, then chill rolled-out dough in the refrigerator for 45 minutes to 1 hour before cutting into shapes and baking.",
      "Royal Icing Make-Ahead Details: You can prepare the royal icing 2-3 days ahead of time. I recommend transferring it to a smaller bowl or container and tightly sealing for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. When you\u2019re ready to use it, let it come to room temperature, then mix it up with a whisk a few times as it may have separated. Whisking in a few drops of water is helpful if it thickened. See Royal Icing page for detailed freezing instructions.",

      "Room Temperature: Room-temperature butter is essential. If the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room-temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. Room-temperature egg is preferred so it\u2019s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie dough.",
      "Lemon Flavor: I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1 teaspoon lemon extract as listed in the ingredients above. You could replace with lemon juice, but the flavor won\u2019t be strong at all. You can also add 2 teaspoons lemon zest as listed. The lemon flavor is optional. If you want to skip the lemon flavor, replace the lemon extract with 1 more teaspoon vanilla extract and skip the zest.",
      "Royal Icing Success Tips: See my complete Royal Icing page for all of my success tips. When you\u2019re not working directly with the royal icing (for example, you are decorating cookies but you still have some icing left in the bowl that you intend to use next), place a damp paper towel directly on the surface of the royal icing. This prevents it from hardening.",

      "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.",

If you\u2019re using the cookie glaze icing, you can use a squeeze bottle or piping bags/tips. Keep in mind that if you want sharp design detail on the Easter eggs, it\u2019s best to use royal icing and piping bags/tips.",

Immediately top with sanding sugar sprinkles. And, for the bunnies, add a halved marshmallow \u201ctail\u201d while the icing is still wet. If making the carrot cookies, outline and flood the orange icing after applying the green sprinkles on the carrot tops. Allow icing to set. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it\u2019s helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you can place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help speed up the icing setting.

      "Freezing Instructions: Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 3, divide in half, flatten both halves into discs as we do with pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the discs in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4, then chill rolled-out dough in the refrigerator for 45 minutes to 1 hour before cutting into shapes and baking.",

      "Room Temperature: Room-temperature butter is essential. If the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room-temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. Room-temperature egg is preferred so it\u2019s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie dough.",
      "Flavors:\u00a0I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as listed in the ingredients above. For lighter flavor, use 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the almond extract, try using 1 teaspoon of maple extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, or peppermint extract. If using lemon extract, you can also add 1 Tablespoon lemon zest.",

      "Make the icing: I have a video for how to make royal icing below. Use that as your guide for this step. Combine sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar, meringue powder, and 9 Tablespoons of water in a large bowl. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat icing ingredients together on high speed for 1.5\u20132 minutes. When lifting the whisk up off the icing, the icing should drizzle down and smooth out within 5\u201310 seconds. If it\u2019s too thick, beat in more water 1 Tablespoon at a time. I usually need 10 Tablespoons, but on particularly dry days, I may use up to 12\u201314 Tablespoons. Keep in mind that the longer you beat the royal icing, the thicker it becomes. If your royal icing is too thin, just keep beating it to introduce more air OR you can add more sifted confectioners\u2019 sugar. Yields about 3 cups of icing.",
      "Separate icing into 6 different bowls. (Or fewer bowls, depending how many colors you want.) Stir in 1 tiny drop of the following colors into each bowl, 1 color per bowl: pink, violet, green, yellow, and orange. The 6th bowl is for the writing. For that, stir in 2\u20133 drops of red. You won\u2019t use the red icing for a couple hours after the base icing sets, so place a damp paper towel directly on the surface of it. This prevents it from hardening.",
      "Spoon or pour the pastel icings into piping bags (disposable or reusable) fitted with round piping tip #4. If you only have 1 tip and want to decorate with multiple colors of icing, keep the tip on the outside of the bag by using a coupler so you can easily transfer the piping tip to other bags of colored icing. Decorate cookies with colored icing by piping a border around the edges and then filling it. Let the icing-covered cookies mostly set, uncovered, for at least 2 hours before adding writing.",
      "Spoon or pour the red icing into a piping bag (disposable or reusable) fitted with round piping tip #2. Write desired words/messages on the cookies (ideas/suggestions listed in the post above!). Writing icing will set within 2\u20133 hours.",
      "Decorated or plain cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for 5 days or in the refrigerator for up to 10 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions:\u00a0Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 3, divide in half, flatten both halves into a disk as we do with\u00a0pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the disks in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4, then chill rolled-out dough in the refrigerator for 45\u201360 minutes before cutting into shapes and baking.",

      "Room Temperature:\u00a0Room temperature butter\u00a0is essential. If the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. Room temperature egg is preferred so it\u2019s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie dough.",
      "Flavors:\u00a0I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as listed in the ingredients above. For lighter flavor, use 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the almond extract, try using 1 teaspoon of maple extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, or peppermint extract. Or add 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground cinnamon. If using lemon extract, you can also add 1 Tablespoon lemon zest.",
      "Easy Glaze Icing: Instead of this royal icing, you can use my easy cookie icing if that\u2019s easier for you. However, I find it nearly impossible to write with that icing because it isn\u2019t stable like royal icing.",

Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl. Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed until combined. Dough is thick, creamy, and sticky.",

Some readers have had trouble with the confectioners\u2019 sugar melting/absorbing into the cookie dough balls, so to prevent that, you can roll the balls in the granulated sugar first. And then roll each ball very generously in the confectioners\u2019 sugar. If you want lots of confectioners\u2019 sugar to show on the baked cookies, roll 2-3x in sugar! Place 3 inches apart on the baking sheets.",
      "Bake the cookies for 12\u201313 minutes or until the edges appear set and the centers still look soft. Tip: If they aren\u2019t really spreading by minute 9, remove them from the oven and lightly bang the baking sheet on the counter 2\u20133x. This helps initiate that spread. Return to the oven to continue baking.",

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: The dough can chill for up to 3 days, so this is a great make-ahead recipe. Baked cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls (that are not coated in confectioners\u2019 sugar) freeze well up to 3 months. When it\u2019s time to bake the cookies, remove them from the freezer and thaw on the counter for at least 30 minutes. Roll into confectioners\u2019 sugar as instructed and bake.",

      "optional: sprinkles"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Make the dough: Whisk\u00a0the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
      "In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.",
      "Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined. Dough will be thick and sticky. Remove from the mixing bowl\u2014no need to rinse out the mixing bowl.",
      "Divide the dough in half: You should have a little less than 2 lbs. of dough, or somewhere between 800\u2013900g. Divide the dough in half. Note: It\u2019s ok if the portions aren\u2019t exactly half. If one half is slightly smaller, use that one for the chocolate dough.",
      "Make the chocolate dough: Place half of the dough back into the mixing bowl. Add the cocoa powder, milk, and espresso powder (if using). Beat on low speed until dough is combined.",
      "Shape & chill for 60\u201390 minutes: The doughs are sticky, so just do your best in this step. Place both doughs on a lightly floured work surface. (Tip: I like to use cocoa powder as my \u201cflour\u201d for handling/rolling the chocolate dough.) With lightly floured hands, carefully form each dough into a 1-inch-thick rectangle block, about 4\u00d75 inches in size. Wrap both dough blocks up in plastic wrap, parchment paper, or aluminum foil. Refrigerate for 60\u201390 minutes. The *key* is to only refrigerate until the dough is less sticky, but still pliable enough to bend and shape. Chilling any longer will make it difficult to roll together. If you need to chill it for longer than 90 minutes, make sure you let it sit at room temperature for 15\u201330 minutes before continuing with the next step.",
      "Roll out the doughs: Remove vanilla dough from the refrigerator and unwrap. Keep chocolate dough in the refrigerator. Lightly flour a piece of parchment paper. Note that I like to place the parchment paper on top of a silicone baking mat to prevent it from sliding all over the counter, or you can tape it down. (Do not roll the doughs directly on the counter because you may have a hard time lifting/transferring them.) Using a lightly floured rolling pin, begin rolling out the vanilla dough. Flip the dough every now and then between rolls to ensure it\u2019s not sticking to the parchment. Roll out to an 8\u00d714-inch rectangle, and use your hands to ensure the sides are straight and smooth. The thickness will be between 1/8\u20131/4 inch. Set the dough aside, and it\u2019s most helpful if you refrigerate the vanilla dough at this time. Pick up the vanilla dough using the parchment paper and place the whole thing in the refrigerator as you roll out the chocolate dough. Lightly dust another piece of parchment paper with flour or cocoa powder. Using a lightly floured (or cocoa powder-ed) rolling pin, roll the chocolate dough out to an 8\u00d714-inch rectangle, or very slightly smaller. Remove vanilla dough from the refrigerator. Carefully peel the chocolate dough off the parchment and do your best to line it up on top of the vanilla dough. Flatten the chocolate dough on top as best you can, gently patting it down to remove any air bubbles between the layers of doughs. Patch any torn chocolate dough pieces back together. And feel free to use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to straighten up any uneven edges.",
      "Roll into a log: Starting with a long side, tightly roll the 2 doughs together, making sure there are no gaps between them. You can use the parchment paper under the vanilla dough to assist in rolling. Go slowly, and try to roll it as tightly as possible. You can kind of meld the doughs together with your fingers at the beginning to get the roll started. (You can see me do this in the video tutorial below.) If you notice bare or cracked spots of vanilla dough, which usually happens (don\u2019t worry!), just patch it up with your fingers as you go. Doesn\u2019t have to look perfect. Once you have your log of dough, cut it in half, so you have two 7-inch-long dough logs.",
      "Chill for 2 more hours:\u00a0Wrap each dough log in plastic wrap, parchment paper, or aluminum foil and refrigerate for 2 more hours and up to 4 days.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).\u00a0Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.",
      "Slice and bake: Slice each log into 14 1/2-inch-thick cookies.\u00a0\u00a0",
      "Arrange cookies about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets\u2014expect these cookies to expand quite a bit in the oven. If the dough got a little soft from working with it, chill the cookies on the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 10 minutes before baking. Bake for 14\u201315 minutes or until very lightly browned around the edges.",
      "Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Optional chocolate dipping: Coarsely chop the chocolate. Melt in a double boiler or the microwave. If using the microwave, stir every 20 seconds until it\u2019s smooth. Dip half of each cooled cookie into the chocolate. Add sprinkles on top of chocolate, if desired.\u00a0Allow chocolate to completely set at room temperature or in the refrigerator.",
      "Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for 1 week. Refrigerate cookies dipped in chocolate after a few days."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: Baked cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature, if desired, before serving.

      "Tinting the dough with food coloring: If you want to tint the vanilla dough a color, you absolutely can. After dividing the dough in half, beat a couple drops (depends on how vibrant you want the color) of gel food coloring into the vanilla dough. If you\u2019re skipping the chocolate dough (see Note below), you can tint both doughs (such as 1 dough red and 1 dough green) OR you can leave 1 dough white and tint the other half (such as white/vanilla and red/peppermint\u2014see Note below about adding flavor extract).",
      "Can I make these without the chocolate/add another flavor? Yes, but you\u2019ll want to tint half of the dough so the pinwheel design shows. (See Note above.) You can keep the flavor of both dough halves vanilla, or add another extract such as peppermint or coconut. If you want the entire dough flavored, go ahead and add 1 teaspoon of your favorite flavor extract when you add the vanilla extract. If you only want to flavor half of the dough, beat 1/2 teaspoon extract into half of the dough before the 1st chill (replace step 5).",
      "Rolling in Sprinkles or Coarse Sugar: After chilling the logs of dough, roll in 1/2 cup (about 100g) sprinkles or coarse sugar before slicing and baking. If the sprinkles/coarse sugar are not sticking to the dough, use a pastry brush to brush the dough very lightly with a little water, and then try coating again.",
      "Chocolate for Dipping: The best chocolate for melting and dipping is the \u201cbaking chocolate\u201d bars found in the baking aisle of the grocery store. I typically use Bakers or Ghirardelli brands. You can use white, semi-sweet, or dark/bittersweet. Do not use chocolate chips because they contain stabilizers, which prevent them from melting into the correct consistency."

      "Can I brown the butter in the cookie dough too? You could, but this recipe requires creamed butter. You\u2019ll have to brown the butter for the dough, and then let it fully solidify and come to room temperature. (You don\u2019t want it cold, because it cannot cream with the sugar.

Roll each dough ball generously in the sprinkles. If the sprinkles are not sticking to the dough balls, the dough may be too firm. Try pouring the sprinkles onto a plate and pressing the dough balls into the sprinkles. Or continue rolling the dough balls, as the warmth from your hands can help get the sprinkles to stick. If this still isn\u2019t helping, beat 1 teaspoon of water into the dough to help make it a bit stickier, and then try again.",

      "Chocolate: The best chocolate for dipping is the \u201cbaking chocolate\u201d bars found in the baking aisle of the grocery store. I typically use Bakers or Ghirardelli brands, either semi-sweet or dark. Do not use chocolate chips because they contain stabilizers, which prevent them from melting into the correct consistency. 4 ounces is enough for a light dip and 6 ounces is plenty for a dip and a little drizzle on top, too. You can use white chocolate if desired instead.",

    "ingredients": [
      "2 and 1/4 cups (281g) all-purpose flour\u00a0(spooned and leveled), plus more as needed for rolling and work surface",
      "1/2 teaspoon baking powder",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt",

      "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
      "1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon\u00a0almond extract\u00a0(optional, but makes the flavor outstanding)*",

      "pinch\u00a0salt*",
      "optional: gel food coloring & sprinkles for decorating"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Make sure you have allotted enough time (and enough counter space!) to make these cookies. The cookie dough needs to chill, the cookies need to cool completely, and the icing needs 24 hours to completely set. If enjoying right away and hardened icing isn\u2019t a concern, you\u2019ll only need about 3\u20134 hours to make these.",
      "Make the cookie dough:\u00a0Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
      "In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extract (if using), and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.",
      "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.",
      "Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick.",
      "Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the second rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1\u20132 hours and up to 2 days.",
      "Once chilled, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line 2\u20133 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it\u2019s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with second piece of dough. (Note: It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.)",
      "Arrange cookies on baking sheets about 3 inches apart. Bake for 11\u201312 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating. No need to cover the cookies as they cool.",
      "Make the icing: Using a fork, stir the confectioners\u2019 sugar, vanilla, corn syrup, and 4.5 Tablespoons (67ml) of water together in a medium bowl. It will be very thick and almost impossible to stir. Switch to a whisk and whisk in 1/2 Tablespoon (8ml) more of water. If you lift the whisk and let the icing drizzle back into the bowl, the ribbon of icing will hold shape for a few seconds before melting back into the icing. That is when you know it\u2019s the right consistency and is ready to use. If it\u2019s too thick (sometimes it is), whisk in another 1/2 Tablespoon (8ml) of water or a little more until you reach the proper consistency.",
      "If you\u2019re tinting the icing another color, stir in the food coloring. You can pour some icing into different bowls if using multiple colors. When tinting icing, use only 1\u20132 drops at first, stir it in, then add more as needed to reach your desired color. Remember, color darkens as icing dries.",
      "Decorate the cookies: You can dip the cookies into the icing or use squeeze bottles or piping bags (reusable or disposable)\u00a0fitted with piping tips (I usually use Wilton Piping Tip #4). Decorate your cookies as desired. If using the squeeze bottles or piping tips, I usually outline cookies with icing first, then fill in the middle. If adding sprinkles on top of the icing, add them right after applying icing on your cookie.",
      "Let icing dry/set: Feel free to enjoy cookies before icing completely dries. Icing dries in 24 hours. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it\u2019s helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you can place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help slightly speed up the icing setting. Once the icing has dried, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending.",
      "Cover and store decorated cookies for up to 5 days at room temperature or up to 10 days in the refrigerator."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 4, divide in half, flatten both halves into a disc as we do with pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the discs in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 5, then chill rolled-out dough in the refrigerator for 45 minutes\u20131 hour before cutting into shapes and baking.",

      "Room Temperature Butter: Room temperature butter is essential. If the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. Room temperature egg is preferred so it\u2019s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie dough.",
      "Flavors:\u00a0I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as listed in the ingredients above. For lighter flavor, use 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the almond extract, try using 1 teaspoon of maple extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, or peppermint extract. Or add 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground cinnamon. If using lemon extract, you can also add 1 Tablespoon lemon zest.",
      "Corn Syrup: Corn syrup gives the icing sticking power and creates a beautiful sheen on the dried icing. I don\u2019t recommend skipping it, but you can if absolutely needed.",
      "Salt: I know salt isn\u2019t a typical ingredient in cookie icing, but it helps offset its sweetness. You need just a small pinch.",
      "Yield of Icing: This amount of icing is enough for icing 2 dozen cookies. You\u2019ll have plenty if you want to divide it and tint the batch multiple colors, too. Icing can easily be halved by halving all of the ingredients. (Still add a tiny pinch of salt.)",

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will be very soft. Fold in 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, if using. The chips may not stick to the dough because of the melted butter, but do your best to combine.",
      "Cover the dough and chill for 30 minutes or up to 3 days. Chilling the dough is a must for this recipe.",

Mix the coating ingredients together, and then roll each cookie dough ball generously in the cinnamon-sugar coating. Arrange cookie dough balls 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Using the back of a spoon or the bottom of a cup/measuring cup, slightly flatten the tops of the dough balls. (Without doing so, the cookies may not spread.)",
      "Bake for 11\u201312 minutes or until the edges appear set. The cookies will look very soft in the center. Remove from the oven.

If desired, press a few white chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies. This is only for looks.",
      "Cool cookies on the baking sheets for at least 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. The longer the cookies cool, the better they taste! The flavor gets stronger and the texture becomes chewier. I usually let them sit, uncovered, for several hours before serving. Chewiness and pumpkin flavor are even stronger on day 2.",
      "Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Allow to come to room temperature, then continue with step 4. Baked cookies freeze well up to 3 months. You can also freeze the cookie dough balls for up to 3 months before baking. It\u2019s best to freeze them without the cinnamon-sugar coating. When you are ready to bake, remove the dough balls from the freezer, let sit for 30 minutes, preheat the oven, and then roll in the cinnamon-sugar topping. Here are my tips for how to freeze cookie dough.",

      "Pumpkin: Squeeze as much of the moisture out of the pumpkin puree as you can before adding it to the cookie dough. I simply squeeze the puree with paper towels. See photo in the post for a visual. This will help produce a less cakey cookie. Less moisture is a good thing here! Measure 6 Tablespoons AFTER the pumpkin has been squeezed/blotted. Do not use pumpkin pie filling.",
      "Pumpkin Pie Spice:\u00a0You can find pumpkin pie spice in the baking aisle of most grocery stores or make your own homemade pumpkin pie spice. If you don\u2019t have either and want to use individual spices, use 1/4 teaspoon each: ground ginger, ground nutmeg, ground cloves, and ground allspice. This is in addition to the 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon\u2014you will still add that.",
      "Chilled Dough: If you are chilling the pumpkin cookie dough for longer than 30 minutes, the cookie dough will likely have to sit on the counter at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before scooping/rolling because it will be quite cold and solid. The amount of time it needs to sit at room temperature depends on how long the dough has chilled. If I chill my cookie dough for around 24 hours, I let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.",
      "Bigger Batch: Cookie recipe can easily be doubled by doubling each ingredient. Chill the cookie dough for 45 minutes.",

      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line 3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (If you don\u2019t have 3 baking sheets, bake the cookies in batches.)",
      "Whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together in a large bowl on medium-high speed until combined and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract, then beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in the dry ingredients on low speed, then beat in the chocolate chips until combined. The dough will be soft and sticky.",
      "Since the dough is so sticky, I recommend using a cookie scoop and this medium size is perfect. Scoop cookie dough into balls, about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie, and arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 12\u201313 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look soft.",
      "Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. If desired, while the cookies are still warm, press extra mini chocolate chips into the tops of the cookies. This is optional and just for looks. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before assembling your ice cream sandwiches.",
      "Assemble the sandwiches: Flip a cooled cookie over and place 1 generous ice cream scoop, about 1/4 cup or 45g, on top. Use your scoop to gently spread the ice cream to the edges. Sandwich a cookie on top, then pick up the assembled sandwich and gently press it all together in the very center to make a compact sandwich. Roll sides into mini chocolate chips, sprinkles, or nuts. If not enjoying right away (they\u2019re messy if you don\u2019t freeze them first), immediately wrap assembled sandwich in plastic wrap or parchment paper and place in the freezer. Repeat with remaining cookies and ice cream.",
      "Freeze for at least 3 hours and up to 3 months."

      "Why the cornstarch and extra egg yolk? Cornstarch helps produce a super soft cookie, which is the ideal bread for a frozen cookie sandwich. Feel free to skip the cornstarch if you don\u2019t have any. An extra egg yolk keeps the cookies flavorful and tender. 1 egg is not enough for this dough and 2 eggs is too many, so just use the yolk of that 2nd egg.",
      "I recommend mini chocolate chips: When frozen, the smaller chips aren\u2019t as rock hard as the regular size chocolate chips. They\u2019re simply easier (and more pleasant) to eat, plus you can enjoy more chocolate in every single bite when you use a smaller chip.",
      "Ice Cream: Use your favorite flavor. There\u2019s no need to soften your ice cream prior to assembling, though if your ice cream is particularly hard to scoop, give it a couple minutes and try again.",
      "Gluten Free Options: Use these flourless almond butter chocolate chip cookies or these flourless peanut butter chocolate cookies as the \u201cbread.\u201d As always, make sure the ice cream you are using is labeled gluten free."

    "instructions": [
      "Make the peanut butter filling: In a small bowl, mix the peanut butter and confectioners\u2019 sugar together until combined and smooth. You can just use a spoon for this. Mixture is thick, yet soft. With a teaspoon, scoop out a spoonful of peanut butter mixture (about 6g), and roll into a ball. Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, plate, or tray. Repeat with remaining mixture until you have 24 peanut butter balls. Loosely cover and freeze for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. (I usually just freeze them for a little over 1 hour, which is the amount of time it takes to make and chill the brownie cookie dough.)",
      "Make the brownie cookie dough: Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or use the microwave. Microwave in 20-second increments, stirring after each until completely melted. Set aside to slightly cool.",
      "Meanwhile, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking powder, and salt together. Set aside. In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and beat on high speed for 2 full minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl, then beat on high for 1 more minute. Pour in the slightly cooled melted chocolate and mix on medium-high speed for 2 full minutes. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and beat on low speed until combined.\u00a0",
      "Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour. If chilling for longer, allow the cookie dough to sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes before rolling and shaping in step 6.",
      "After chilling, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.\u00a0",
      "Shape the cookies: The peanut butter filling softens up extremely quickly after you take it out of the freezer. I recommend taking about 6 peanut butter balls out of the freezer at a time, leaving the rest in the freezer while you\u2019re shaping the first bunch. Using a sturdy tablespoon, scoop out a heaping spoonful of the cookie dough and roll into a ball, about 1.5 Tablespoons/30g/1 ounce of dough each. The dough will be quite stiff. Make an indentation with your thumb, and place a frozen peanut butter ball in the indentation. Pinch off a piece of the brownie cookie dough and press it on top of the peanut butter filling, and then roll the whole thing together into a smooth ball. Feel free to pull off pieces of brownie dough to expose more peanut butter and then re-roll together; peanut butter can also be hidden inside the cookie dough if you don\u2019t want a marbled look. Repeat with remaining cookie dough and peanut butter balls. (Warning: your hands get messy in this step!)",
      "Place dough balls 3 inches apart on the baking sheets and bake for 12-13 minutes or until the edges appear set. The centers will be quite soft, but will set up as the cookies cool.",

We tested it with Skippy Creamy, Justin\u2019s Natural Creamy, and Wegmans brand Natural Creamy. If using natural and the oil has separated to the top of the jar, make sure you stir it well before measuring. Room temperature peanut butter is easiest to mix. I do not recommend crunchy peanut butter because it doesn\u2019t mix very easily with the confectioners\u2019 sugar.",

With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick.",
      "Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and then refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days.",
      "Once chilled, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it\u2019s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd piece of dough. (Note: It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.)",
      "Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating.",
      "Make the buttercream frosting: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and vanilla bean seeds together on medium speed until butter is creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, heavy cream, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds and then increase to medium-high speed and beat for 2 full minutes. Taste. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. To color the frosting, divide the frosting between 2-3 bowls (or however many colors of frosting you want). Stir in 1-2 tiny drops of gel food coloring (or more, depending on your desired color).",
      "Frost the cooled cookies: You can decorate the cookies with a knife, icing spatula, or use a piping bag and piping tip. Top with sprinkles, if desired. In the pictured cookies, I filled a piping bag with spoonfuls of both green and uncolored frosting and used Ateco 30 piping tip. Pipe hearts as the 3 leaves and a line as the stem.",
      "Frosting does not harden or crust very much, though you could gently stack 1 frosted cookie on top of another, but expect some slight squishing.

      "Room Temperature: Room temperature butter is essential. If the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. You can read more about it in this room temperature butter post. Room temperature egg is preferred so it\u2019s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie dough.",
      "Vanilla Bean: This recipe calls for the seeds from 1 whole vanilla bean in the cookie dough and from 1/2 of a vanilla bean in the frosting. (For extra flavor, feel free to use 1 whole bean in the frosting too.) To get the seeds out of a vanilla bean, use a small knife to cut the vanilla bean lengthwise and then use the dull side of the knife to scrape out the vanilla seeds.",
      "Using Vanilla Bean Paste Instead: If you have vanilla bean paste, you can use that instead of vanilla bean. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste when you add the vanilla extract.

Set aside 1 hour to chill the dough in the refrigerator before baking.",
    "ingredients": [
      "3/4 cup (12 Tbsp; 170g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
      "3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar (I use dark)",
      "1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar",
      "1 large egg, at room temperature",
      "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
      "2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)",

    "instructions": [
      "In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar together on medium speed until combined and creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.",
      "In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt together. On low speed, slowly mix into the wet ingredients until combined. The cookie dough will be soft and thick. Add the white chocolate chips and dried cranberries and beat on low speed until combined. Cover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 3-4 days. Chilling is imperative to prevent the cookies from over-spreading.",
      "Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator. If the cookie dough chilled longer than 3-4 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This makes the firm cookie dough easier to scoop and roll.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.",
      "As the oven preheats, scoop and roll dough, about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough each, into balls. The dough may be slightly crumbly, but will come together as you work it with your hands. Arrange dough balls 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.",
      "Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. The centers will still look soft. If cookies didn\u2019t spread much, lightly bang the the baking sheets on the counter a couple times while the cookies are still warm. They\u2019ll stretch and deflate.",
      "Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. During this time, press extra white chocolate chips and dried cranberries into the warm tops. This is optional and only for looks. After 5 minutes, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week."

      "Make the icing: In a double boiler, melt the chocolate and butter together stirring constantly over low heat. OR microwave in a medium heat-proof bowl in 20 second increments, stirring after each until completely melted. Stirring is essential as the butter/chocolate may separate otherwise. Once smooth, remove from heat and stir in the corn syrup. Dip half of each cooled cookie into the chocolate (to make a half-moon effect) and, if desired, lightly sprinkle crushed peanuts or flaky sea salt on the chocolate. Return the cookies to the cooling rack to set, about 1-2 hours. Feel free to place cookies in the refrigerator to speed up the setting time.",

      "Peanuts or Other Add-Ins: I used salted dry-roasted peanuts as the add-in in this cookie dough. You can use unsalted and/or raw peanuts if desired. Instead you can use any of the listed add-ins including peanut butter chips, butterscotch chips, or chocolate chips. Or use a combination totaling 1 cup.",
      "Chocolate: You can certainly use 1 and 1/2 cups (or anywhere between 220-270g) high quality chocolate chips, but I love using chopped baking chocolate. Baking chocolate is sold in the baking aisle as 4 ounce bars, so you need 2. Feel free to use semi-sweet or bittersweet.",
      "Adapted from King Arthur Baking Company The Essential Cookie Companion. The recipe is wonderful and found on page 68 in the cookbook. I added a chill time which helps make slightly thicker cookies as pictured. I also reduced the corn syrup in the icing and added 1/2 cup extra chocolate to the icing so it makes a little more. (I dip the cookies heavily!) This printable recipe includes those 2 small changes. A little garnish of crushed peanuts or sea salt is optional."

      "Make + Cool the Caramel: Heat granulated sugar in a medium heavy-duty saucepan (avoid using non-stick) over medium heat, stirring constantly with a high heat resistant silicone spatula or wooden spoon. Sugar will form clumps and eventually melt into a thick brown, amber-colored liquid as you continue to stir. Once sugar is completely melted, immediately stir in the butter until melted and combined. Be careful in this step because the caramel will bubble rapidly when the butter is added. If you notice the butter separating or if the sugar clumps up, remove from heat and vigorously whisk to combine it again. (If you\u2019re nervous for splatter, wear kitchen gloves. Keep whisking until it comes back together, even if it takes 3-4 minutes. It will eventually\u2014just keep whisking. Return to heat when it\u2019s combined again.) After the butter has melted and combined with the caramelized sugar, cook for 1 minute without stirring. Slowly stir in 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Since the heavy cream is colder than the hot caramel, the mixture will rapidly bubble when added. After all the heavy cream has been added, stop stirring and boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in the salt. Cool caramel for at least 3 hours at room temperature. Caramel thickens as it cools.",
      "Spoon 2 heaping teaspoons of caramel onto bottom of whole cookies.\u00a0Carefully top each with a donut cookie and gently press down to create a cookie sandwich.",
      "Cookies will stay fresh covered at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: You can chill the cookie dough in the refrigerator for up to 4 days (see step 5), but you can also freeze it for up to 3 months. If you freeze it, allow the dough to thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature before rolling out in step 7. Cookie sandwiches freeze well for up to 3 months; thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving. For the caramel: You can make the caramel in advance. Make sure it is covered tightly and store it in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. This caramel is fine at room temperature for up to 2 days. You can freeze the salted caramel, too. Freeze in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature, then briefly warm up in the microwave until it\u2019s a good consistency to spoon or spread on the cookies. (You still want it to be slightly thick.)",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Food Processor | Glass Mixing Bowl | Whisk | Electric Mixer (Handheld or Stand) | Baking Sheets | Silicone Baking Mats or Parchment Paper | Rolling Pin | 2- or 2.5-inch Cookie Cutter (like this square set (pictured) or this round set) | 1-inch Cookie Cutter (like the star from this set) | Fine Mesh Sieve | Cooling Rack | Saucepan | Silicone Spatula or Wooden Spoon",
      "Nuts:\u00a0For a nut-free version that skips the food processor, you can use my sugar cookies dough. Feel free to add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, the same amount you use in today\u2019s dough. You can replace the hazelnuts with the same amount of almonds, pistachios, walnuts or pecans. You can use raw or dry-roasted nuts and since you\u2019re breaking them down in the food processor, it doesn\u2019t matter if you start with whole or chopped nuts. Feel free to use salted or unsalted, depending if you want a slightly salty/sweet flavor. I usually use unsalted in this recipe.",
      "Sugar in Caramel: Like the salted caramel version, this caramel recipe is most successful using granulated sugar that\u2019s labeled \u201cpure cane\u201d on the packaging. I usually use and recommend Domino brand regular granulated sugar which says \u201cpure cane granulated\u201d on the packaging.",
      "Heavy Cream: Heavy cream (approximately 36% milk fat) may also be sold as whipping cream. Light whipping cream (30% milk fat) or double cream (48% milk fat) may be substituted. Do not use milk. Room temperature cream is best."

(Tip: Parchment is used so you can easily remove the shortbread and not cut it while it\u2019s in the pan. I like to use a square of parchment and I cut a 1-inch slit in the center of each side. This helps reduce the amount of creases when lined in the pan.)",

Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as necessary. Add the vanilla and salt and beat until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as necessary. Add the flour and cornstarch and beat on low speed for 1 minute as the mixture begins to combine. Turn the mixer up to medium speed and beat for 1-3 minutes or until the dough clumps together. (It will eventually, just keep mixing it.) If you\u2019re adding dry add-ins (see above), this is when you\u2019ll add them.",
      "Divide dough in half. If you want to be totally accurate, weigh the halves to make sure they\u2019re even. Recipe makes almost 1.5 lbs of plain dough (will weigh more if you added add-ins). Press each half of dough into a prepared cake pan. You want it nice and compact in the pans. Sprinkle with optional coarse sugar. Dock the surface all over with a fork to prevent air bubbles.",
      "Bake the shortbread for 28-30 minutes or until very lightly browned on top and around the edges.",
      "Remove from the oven, place pans on a wire rack, and cool shortbread for 10-15 minutes. Carefully remove the shortbread from the pans by picking it up with the parchment paper on the sides. Cut each into 8 large, 12 medium, or 16 small wedges. You want to make sure you cut the shortbread while it\u2019s still warm. Enjoy warm or cool shortbread completely on wire racks.",
      "Cover and store shortbread at room temperature for up to 1 week. If you added a topping such as glaze, icing, buttercream, or melted chocolate, refrigerate after 2 days."

      "Pan Size: I recommend 8-inch round cake pans. If using 9-inch round cake pans, the cookies will be quite thin unless you added an add-in to the dough. Bake time will be slightly shorter if using 9-inch pans. Bake until tops and edges are very lightly browned. See post above for directions for shortbread bars in square or rectangle pans.",

      "Bake & cool: Arrange shaped cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until edges are set. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating.",
      "Make either icing: Prepare the royal icing or easy cookie icing. Divide the icing into separate bowls if you wish to tint it different colors using gel food coloring. I divided the icing into 4 equal portions, left 1 portion white, and tinted the other portions of icing orange, black, and green. When tinting icing, only use 1-2 drops at first, stir it in, then add more as needed to reach your desired color. I usually need quite a few drops to make black icing. (Remember, color darkens as icing dries.)",
      "Decorate the cookies: Read this step completely before starting and see recipe notes for recommended decorating tools. Spoon icing into piping bags fitted with Wilton Piping Tip #4. If you kept the icing white or are only using 1 color of icing, you just need 1 piping bag. Slowly pipe icing border around the cookies, and then fill the center with more icing. Keep the icing a thin layer so it dries faster. You can also decorate the cookies how I do in the video tutorial, including sprinkle stripes on the witch hats and sprinkle body on the bat. (These looks work with royal icing or the easy glaze icing.) No need to let the sprinkle stripes/sprinkle body dry before piping icing on the other parts of the cookie. You also do not have to wait for the orange icing to dry before piping the green stem on the pumpkin. If piping green leaves and a face on the pumpkin to make a Jack-O-Lantern, use royal icing and make sure the orange icing sets before adding these additional layers. (Royal icing is best for fine detail/layers.) I did quite a few royal icing Jack-O-Lantern looks in the picture above and the easiest is slanted semi-circles for eyes, triangle nose, and a curved zig-zag smile. If you ever need to thicken royal icing because it has thinned out while you\u2019re decorating or you want thicker icing for piping fine detail, you can beat 2-3 extra Tablespoons of confectioners\u2019 sugar into it to help it thicken up. If adding eyeballs to the cookies, pipe a tiny dot of icing on the back of the eyeball before gently pressing onto the iced cookie. As always, take your time icing the cookies and know that each and every one won\u2019t be perfect.",
      "Let icing dry/set: Royal icing dries in about 2 hours and easy glaze icing dries in 24 hours. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it\u2019s helpful, transfer cookies to a baking sheet and place them in the refrigerator to help slightly speed up the icing setting.",
      "Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending. Plain or decorated cookies stay soft for about 5 days when covered tightly at room temperature. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions:\u00a0Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 3, divide in half, flatten both halves into a disk as we do with\u00a0pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, and then freeze. To thaw, thaw the disks in the refrigerator and then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4 and then chill rolled out dough in the refrigerator for 45 minutes\u20141 hour before cutting into shapes and baking.",

    "instructions": [
      "First, make sure you have removed excess liquid from the pumpkin puree by blotting it as much as you can with a clean kitchen tea towel or paper towels. This dough will not turn out properly with the pumpkin\u2019s excess moisture. After blotting excess liquid, you should have about 1/3 cup (75g) to use in the recipe. See recipe note.",
      "Make the dough: In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the pumpkin and vanilla extract, and then beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. It\u2019s ok if the mixture looks curdled. Add the flour, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, baking powder, and salt. Beat on low speed until combined and a thick dough forms.",
      "Shape and fill: Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. If you want to be accurate and weigh the dough, each half should be around or a little more than 12 ounces each. On a floured work surface using floured hands, pat each into a small rectangle. Then, using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll each portion of dough out into a 10\u00d78 inch rectangle. It should be about 1/4\u2033 thick. As you\u2019re rolling, use your hands to help keep the sides straight as you see me do in the video. Spread half of the melted butter onto each rectangle\u2014doesn\u2019t need to be exactly half, just eyeball it. It will be a thick layer of butter. Mix the brown sugar, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon together then sprinkle evenly over each. Using the back of a spoon, pat the brown sugar and spices down into the butter to help it stick.",
      "Working slowly using your fingertips, tightly roll up each rectangle into a 10-inch log. If the dough is cracking at all, use your fingers to smooth it out. (See troubleshooting above if needed.) Wrap the dough logs in plastic wrap, parchment paper, or aluminum foil. Chill the dough logs for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days in the refrigerator. (Or freeze for up to 3 months, see freezing instructions below.) The pictured cookie dough logs chilled in the refrigerator for 1 day.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.",
      "Remove dough logs from the refrigerator. Using a sharp knife, cut each into slices that are slightly less than 1/2 inch (between 1/4 and 1/2 inch is perfect). You\u2019ll have around 24-26 cookies per log. Arrange sliced cookies onto baking sheets 1.5-2 inches apart. If the slices have lost their round shape, use your fingers to help mold them into perfect circles again. Not necessary of course, but you can see me do it in the video.",
      "Bake for 13-15 minutes or until very lightly browned around the bottoms. (As the cookies bake, you can make the icing in the next step.) Remove finished cookies from the oven, allow to cool on the baking sheet for 10 full minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack.",

    "instructions": [
      "Brown the butter: Set out a medium heat-proof bowl because you\u2019ll need it at the end of this step. Slice the butter into Tablespoon-size pieces and place in a light-colored skillet or large pot. Light colored helps you determine when the butter begins browning. (See note if using a dark skillet or pot.) Melt the butter over medium heat and stir or whisk constantly. Once melted, the butter will begin to foam. Keep stirring/whisking. After 5-7 minutes, the butter will begin browning and you\u2019ll notice lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan. It will have a nutty aroma. Once browned, remove from heat immediately and pour into the bowl, including any solids that have formed on the bottom of the pan. (You want those solids for flavor.) Cool brown butter for 5 minutes. Don\u2019t cool longer than that because the butter will begin to thicken and, as a result, the cookie dough will be difficult to mix and its texture will be very crumbly.",
      "Whisk the brown sugar and granulated sugar into the brown butter and then whisk in the eggs and vanilla extract. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the chopped chocolate and pecans, then stir together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. Dough will be greasy, thick, and even slightly crumbly.",
      "Cover cookie dough and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours and up to 3 days before baking. (You can also freeze the dough balls, see Freezing Instructions below.) If chilling for longer than 2 hours, allow the dough to sit at room temperature for at least 20-30 minutes before rolling and baking in the next step. The cookie dough is quite firm otherwise.",
      "Towards the end of chill time, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.",
      "Roll or scoop the dough into balls, 1.5 Tablespoons of dough each. I recommend a\u00a0medium cookie scoop. Place 3 inches apart on the baking sheets and bake for 13-14 minutes or until the edges appear set. (Tip: If cookies aren\u2019t spreading by the 10 minute mark, remove pan from the oven, carefully bang it on the counter to help induce some spreading, and then return it to the oven to finish baking.)",

      "Chocolate: You can certainly use 1 and 1/2 cups (or anywhere between 220-270g) chocolate chips, but I recommend chopped baking chocolate. Baking chocolate is sold in the baking aisle as 4 ounce bars, so you need 2. I strongly recommend Ghirardelli brand and I like their \u201c60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Bars.\u201d I\u2019m not working with this company\u2014this chocolate is simply one of my favorites for cookies. I also like Bakers brand. Feel free to use semi-sweet, bittersweet, milk chocolate, or white chocolate in this recipe.",
      "Pecans: I always use unsalted raw pecans. If you love salty sweet cookies, you can use salted/roasted pecans. Can I toast the pecans? You don\u2019t have to, but you can for added flavor. Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Spread the chopped pecans on top and toast for 7-8 minutes or until fragrant and lightly browned. Cool before adding to cookie dough.",
      "Can I leave out the nuts? Yes, absolutely. I wouldn\u2019t add more chocolate in its place\u2014simply leave out the nuts. If you\u2019d like to add another add-in, try 1 cup (about 140g) dried cranberries or dried cherries or 1 cup\u00a0(150g) Heath Bar Bits O\u2019 Brickle English Toffee.",
      "Darker skillet/pot when browning butter:\u00a0I recommend using a light-colored skillet or large pot when browning butter so you can see when the butter is done. (It\u2019s only a quick few seconds between browned butter and burnt butter.) Towards the end of 5-7 minutes, check for doneness by spooning some butter into a glass bowl to determine if it has browned."

    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Optional but recommended: Pulse the coconut shreds in a food processor or chop them up with a sharp knife so they are finer. Smaller pieces make a more desirable texture in the baked cookies. Set aside for step 3.",

      "In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until creamed, about 1 minute. Add the egg, lime juice, lime zest, and coconut extract and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Mixture will appear curdled and that\u2019s ok. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl. Turn the mixer down to medium speed and beat in the coconut. Add the dry ingredients and beat on low speed until combined. Dough is thick, creamy, and sticky.",
      "Cover and chill the cookie dough in the refrigerator for at least 1.5 hours (and up to 4 days). If chilling for longer than a few hours, allow to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite firm.",

      "Pour remaining sugar into a large bowl. Roll cookie dough into balls, about 1 Tablespoon of dough per cookie. Roll each in granulated sugar. Arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets.",
      "Bake for 12-13 minutes or until very lightly browned on the sides.",
      "Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Make the glaze: Whisk the glaze ingredients together. If desired, add more confectioners\u2019 sugar to thicken or more juice to thin out. The thicker the glaze, the whiter (and less translucent) it will be. Drizzle on cooled cookies and feel free to garnish each with more shredded coconut and/or lime zest. Icing will set after about 1 hour, so these are convenient to store and transport.",
      "Cookies without glaze stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. Cookies with glaze stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Cookie dough balls without coating in sugar freeze well for up to 3 months. Thaw for 30 minutes, coat each in sugar, then bake. Read my tips and tricks on how to freeze cookie dough. Baked cookies, with or without glaze, freeze well for up to 3 months.",

      "Sweetened Shredded Coconut: I strongly recommend using sweetened shredded coconut because it\u2019s moister than unsweetened and that makes a big difference in the cookie\u2019s flavor, moisture, and texture. Knowing the texture and flavor will change, you can use unsweetened coconut flakes if that\u2019s all you have. Give them a rough chop or pulse in the food processor as instructed in step 1.",
      "Cornstarch: If you don\u2019t have cornstarch, you can leave it out. It helps maintain a thicker, softer cookie but test batches without it were still intact and delicious.",
      "Limes: You can use regular limes or key limes. Since they\u2019re so tiny, you need at least 7-8 key limes for this amount of juice (in the dough and glaze) and zest. If using regular limes, you need about 3. Feel free to use lemon juice/zest instead of lime. I haven\u2019t tested this recipe without citrus. If you want a plain coconut cookie, try these coconut macadamia nut cookies, skip the nuts, and add 1 teaspoon coconut extract when you beat in the vanilla extract."

    "description": "These sweet and salty brown butter toffee chocolate chip cookies are soft and chewy in the centers with deliciously crisp edges. Brown butter is the secret to their unbeatable flavor.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup (16 Tbsp; 226g) unsalted butter",
      "1 cup (200g) packed light or dark brown sugar",
      "1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar",
      "2 large eggs, at room temperature",

      "1 cup (150g) Heath Bar Bits O\u2019 Brickle English Toffee",
      "optional: coarse sea salt"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Brown the butter: Set out a medium heat-proof bowl because you\u2019ll need it at the end of this step. Slice the butter into Tablespoon-size pieces and place in a light-colored skillet or large pot. Light colored helps you determine when the butter begins browning. (See note if using a dark skillet or pot.) Melt the butter over medium heat and stir or whisk constantly. Once melted, the butter will begin to foam. Keep stirring/whisking. After 5-7 minutes, the butter will begin browning and you\u2019ll notice lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan. It will have a nutty aroma. Once browned, remove from heat immediately and pour into the bowl, including any solids that have formed on the bottom of the pan. (You want those solids for flavor.) Cool brown butter for 5 minutes. Don\u2019t cool longer than that because the butter will begin to thicken and, as a result, the cookie dough will be difficult to mix and its texture will be too crumbly.",
      "Whisk the brown sugar and granulated sugar into the brown butter and then whisk in the eggs and vanilla extract. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the chocolate chips and toffee, then stir together with a large spoon or rubber spatula. The dough will seem too dry at first, but keeping stirring until it comes together. Dough will be greasy, thick, and a bit crumbly.",
      "Scoop dough into balls, about 1 and 1/2 Tablespoons of dough each, and place on a large plate or baking sheet. I like to roll each cookie dough ball between my hands to smooth them out since they can be a little crumbly. Cover and chill the cookie dough balls in the refrigerator for 2 hours and up to 3 days before baking. (You can also freeze the dough balls, see Freezing Instructions below.)",
      "Towards the end of chill time, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.",
      "Arrange cookie dough balls 3 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. If desired, lightly sprinkle coarse sea salt on top of each. Press the salt down into the cookie dough balls if it\u2019s not sticking.",
      "Bake for 12-13 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. While the cookies are still warm, I like to press a few more chocolate chips or toffee pieces into the tops\u2013 this is only for looks! Cookies are extra soft out of the oven, but become chewier as they cool.",
      "Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the refrigerator for 1 week."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Baked cookies freeze well up to three months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well up to three months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute, no need to thaw. Here\u2019s how to freeze cookie dough.",
      "Darker skillet/pot when browning butter:\u00a0I recommend using a light-colored skillet or large pot when browning butter so you can see when the butter is done. (It\u2019s only a quick few seconds between browned butter and burnt butter.) Towards the end of 5-7 minutes, check for doneness by spooning some butter into a glass bowl to determine if it has browned.",

    "prep_time": "1 hour (plus aging egg whites)",

    "total_time": "1 hour, 30 minutes",
    "serves": "about 40 shells; 20 sandwiched macarons",
    "description": "Review this page, video, troubleshooting, and success tips and follow the recipe precisely for crisp, chewy, delicate French macaron cookies. Have fun with fillings! I provide some filling ideas in the recipe notes. We strongly recommend using gram measurements, but see recipe note if you do not have a kitchen scale.",
    "ingredients": [
      "100g egg whites (usually between 3\u20134 large egg whites)",
      "1/4 teaspoon (1g) cream of tartar",
      "1/2 teaspoon extract such as vanilla, almond, coconut, etc. (optional)",
      "80g superfine sugar (aka caster sugar, see note)",
      "1\u20132 drops gel food coloring (optional)",
      "125g almond flour",
      "125g confectioners\u2019 sugar\u00a0",
      "desired macaron filling (some options listed in notes)"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Wipe down a large glass or metal mixing bowl with lemon juice or vinegar. Add egg whites. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours, then bring to room temperature.",
      "Line 3 large baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. Set aside.",
      "Add cream of tartar and extract (if using) to egg whites. Using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat together on medium speed until very soft peaks form. This takes a few minutes of beating. At first the egg white and cream of tartar mixture will be foamy, then the bubbles will begin to tighten and the beaters will leave tracks as the egg whites build volume. Once they begin leaving tracks, you likely have soft peaks. Stop beating. Add about 1/3 of the superfine sugar. Beat on medium-high speed for 5 seconds, then with the mixer continuing to run, add another 1/3 of the sugar. Beat for 5 seconds, then with the mixer continuing to run, add the remaining sugar. Beat on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form. (This means the whites have stiff, smooth, and sharp points in the bowl or on the lifted whisk attachment/beaters. Stiff peaks do not droop down. You can turn the bowl upside down and the egg whites will not move or spill out.)\u00a0Using a rubber spatula, slowly and gently fold the food coloring (if using) into the egg whites.",
      "Sift the almond flour and confectioners\u2019 sugar together in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Use a spoon to help work any larger pieces through the sieve. You don\u2019t want to discard a lot of that because then you won\u2019t have enough dry ingredients in the batter.",
      "Slowly fold the beaten egg whites into the almond flour mixture in 3 separate additions, folding until combined before adding the next addition. After you add all of the egg whites, pay very close attention to the consistency of your macaron batter. Continue folding the batter (which deflates air) until it thins out into the consistency of honey. What\u2019s a more helpful cue is the figure 8 test. Drop the macaron batter off of your spatula in the form of a figure 8. The figure 8 should take no more than 10 seconds to sink back into itself. If it takes less, your batter was overmixed and is too thin. If it takes longer, continue slowly folding the batter to deflate more air, then perform the figure 8 test again. It\u2019s best to go very slow so you don\u2019t accidentally overmix.",
      "Spoon the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a medium round piping tip, such as Wilton 12, Wilton 1A, or even Ateco 806. The macaron batter is very drippy, so transferring to the piping bag can be messy.",
      "Holding the piping bag at a 90 degree angle over the baking sheet, pipe batter in 1.5 \u2013 2 inch rounds about 1-2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets. I usually pipe little mounds\u2014see video tutorial above. The piped macaron batter flattens out. Bang the pan a couple times on the counter to pop any air bubbles, then use a toothpick to pop any remaining air bubbles.",
      "Let the piped macarons sit out until they are dry and no longer tacky on top, usually 30-60 minutes. This time allows the top to firm up and form a skin, which helps the macarons rise UP and form their trademark ruffly \u201cfeet.\u201d Do not let them sit out for longer than they need to because they could begin to deflate.",
      "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C).",
      "Bake for 13 minutes. As the macaron shells bake, they should form feet. To test for doneness, lightly touch the top of a macaron with a spoon or your finger (careful, it\u2019s hot). If the macaron seems wobbly, it\u2019s not done and needs another 1-2 minutes. If it seems set, it\u2019s done. Basically, bake until the macarons don\u2019t move around when touched.",
      "Let the shells cool on the baking sheet for 15 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack to continue cooling. The macaron shells may stick to the parchment paper/baking sheet if you try to remove them too early. If this is happening, let them cool on the baking sheet a little longer before removing.",
      "After cooling, the shells are ready to fill and sandwich together. I have plenty of filling suggestions in the recipe notes below. You can spread filling with a knife or pipe it using\u00a0the same round tip you used for the macaron batter.",
      "You can eat right away or, as some professionals prefer, cover and refrigerate them 12-24 hours so the macarons and flavors can mature. Bring to room temperature before serving. (I usually just serve them right away!)",
      "Cover leftover macarons and refrigerate for up to 5 days."

    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: Cooled macaron shells and finished assembled macarons can be frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw at room temperature before filling/serving.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Electric Mixer (Handheld or Stand) | Glass Mixing Bowls or\u00a0Metal Mixing Bowls | Egg Separator | Food Scale | Fine Mesh Sieve | Piping Bag (Disposable or Reusable) | Medium-Round Piping Tip (Wilton 12, Wilton 1A, or Ateco 806) | Baking Sheets | Silicone Baking Mat, Macaron-Specific Silicone Baking Mat, or Parchment Paper",
      "Ingredient Substitutions & Weights: I do not recommend any ingredient substitutions in this recipe. Using weights (and a food scale) is the best way to guarantee success. However if you do not own one, use the following approximate measurements: for the superfine sugar, use 1/3 cup. For the almond flour and confectioners\u2019 sugar, you need about 1 cup + 1 teaspoon each.",
      "Egg Whites: For best and most consistent results, I strongly recommend using fresh egg whites instead of liquid egg whites from a carton.",
      "Extract/Flavoring: I keep these macarons plain. Without flavoring, they have a sweet almond flavor. However, if desired, feel free to add 1/2 teaspoon of your favorite extract such as almond, vanilla, coconut, lemon, etc.",
      "Make Your Own Superfine Sugar: Add 80g of regular granulated sugar to your food processor or blender. Pulse about 10-15x until granules are much finer, aka superfine sugar. Weigh 80g superfine sugar\u2014should be about the same amount you started with.",
      "Optional Food Coloring: Tinting macaron batter is completely optional. If you don\u2019t tint it, the macarons will be a natural beige color. Avoid using liquid food coloring because it will change the consistency of your macaron batter. Instead, use 1-2 drops of gel food coloring. (I used dusty rose, aqua, and fuchsia.) Powder food coloring should be fine, but I haven\u2019t tested it. Only use a very small amount.",
      "Almond Flour: Make sure you use almond flour, not almond meal. It is usually labeled as \u201cfine\u201d almond flour. Almond flour is much finer than almond meal and made from blanched, skinless almonds. Almond meal is coarser and contains almond skin. You can make your own almond flour, but be very careful because almonds can quickly release their oils, clump up, and turn into almond butter. It might be easier to just pick up a bag of fine almond flour. It\u2019s very common in mostly all grocery stores these days\u2013 I use and love Bob\u2019s Red Mill brand.",
      "Macaron Filling Ideas: The pictured macarons are filled with vanilla buttercream (I prepared a half batch). Other ideas are a 1/2 batch of chocolate buttercream, lemon buttercream, chocolate peanut butter frosting, Nutella frosting, cream cheese frosting, champagne frosting, strawberry frosting, or a full batch of peanut butter frosting. Cooled and thickened chocolate ganache or cooled salted caramel are great, too!"

      "Dough Chilling: Chilling the cookie dough is imperative. These cookies are very buttery and the colder the cookie dough, the less your cookies will over-spread. The cookie dough can get a little hard after 2 hours in the refrigerator, so I recommend rolling the dough into balls before chilling. Here are all of my tips on how to prevent cookies from spreading.",
      "Crystallized Ginger: You can find crystallized ginger at most grocery stores\u2014it\u2019s usually in the produce aisle but could also be found in the natural foods section or even by the dried fruit. You can use finely chopped/minced fresh ginger root instead, but make sure you reduce down to 1 Tablespoon in the cookie dough. Do not dip the cookie dough balls in it like we do with crystallized ginger because it will burn. If you don\u2019t have either crystallized ginger or fresh ginger root, increase the ground ginger to 1 teaspoon.",
      "Ground Allspice: Allspice is a common spice found in the spice aisle. If you don\u2019t have or can\u2019t find it, use 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves, and 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg in its place.",
      "Lemon: 1 medium lemon is enough for this recipe. You should get 1 Tablespoon of zest from 1 medium lemon, plus enough juice for both the dough and glaze.",

In a medium bowl, whisk the 3 eggs, oil, and vanilla extract together. Pour into the flour/butter mixture and gently mix together with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula until everything is just barely moistened. It will be very crumbly, see photo above for a visual.",
      "Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and with floured hands, knead lightly until the dough is soft and slightly sticky, about 8-10 times. If it\u2019s sticking all over your hands, knead 1-2 more Tablespoon(s) of flour into the dough. Divide the dough in two and place each half onto a baking sheet. Shape each half into an 8-9 inch long slab, patting down until each is about 1/2 inch thick. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the top and sides of each biscotti slab with egg wash.",
      "Bake in batches (or together) for 25-26 minutes, or until the top and sides of the biscotti slabs are lightly browned. Remove from the oven, but do not turn off the heat. Allow to cool for 10 minutes. Once the slabs are cool enough to handle, cut each into 1 inch wide slices. Set slices cut sides upright, \u00bc inch apart, on the baking sheets. (It\u2019s tricky to set the end slices upright, so just turn them over.) Return to the oven to continue baking for 8 minutes. Turn biscotti over and bake other side for 8 minutes. The cookies will be slightly soft in the centers with harder edges.",
      "Remove from the oven and cool the biscotti for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before dipping in white chocolate. The biscotti becomes more and more crunchy as it cools. It\u2019s helpful to save the baking sheets for the next step.",

      "Freezing Instructions: Baked and cooled biscotti can be frozen for up to 3 months, with or without chocolate. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before dipping in white chocolate and/or serving. You can also freeze the slabs of dough before brushing with egg wash and baking. If doing this, I recommend patting down/flattening the dough slabs directly on a piece of plastic wrap or aluminum foil so you don\u2019t have to transfer it. Wrap it up in the plastic wrap/foil, then freeze up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature before brushing with egg wash and baking.",

      "Vanilla Sugar/Sugar: I strongly recommend making this biscotti with vanilla sugar. What exceptional flavor it adds! Vanilla sugar is very easy to make and you can find my tutorial in my vanilla sugar post. If you don\u2019t have or don\u2019t want to make vanilla sugar, use regular granulated sugar. For pronounced vanilla flavor, though, add the seeds scraped from half of a vanilla bean. Whisk the seeds in with the 3 eggs, oil, and vanilla extract. If you have vanilla bean paste, you can use that instead of vanilla bean. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste with the vanilla extract. If you want to replace the vanilla extract with vanilla bean paste too, use 1 Tablespoon paste and whisk it in with the 3 eggs + oil.",
      "Reduce Sweetness: These are relatively sweet biscotti, so feel free to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup (100g) if you\u2019d like. If doing so, I recommend adding 2 Tablespoons (16g) of all-purpose flour. The biscotti will taste a little plain.",
      "White Chocolate: Use pure white chocolate baking bars. You can find them right next to the chocolate chips in the baking aisle. They are sold in 4 ounce bars, so you\u2019ll need 2. I like Bakers or Ghirardelli brands. I use and recommend white chocolate so it doesn\u2019t overpower the vanilla, but you can semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate instead.",
      "Want an add-in in this biscotti? When you\u2019re finished step 2 and before you turn the dough out onto a work surface to shape, fold in 1 cup of any of the following: dried cranberries, white chocolate chips, chopped hazelnuts, pecans, or walnuts, cinnamon chips, or semi-sweet chocolate chips."

Do not use the whole brick either\u2014that\u2019s too much and the cookies will over-spread. If using low fat or fat free, keep in mind that the texture of the cookies will be different.

Wrap both dough blocks up in plastic wrap or place on a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Refrigerate for just 1 hour. The *key* is to only refrigerate until the dough is less sticky, but still pliable enough to bend and shape. Chilling any longer will make it difficult to form a neat checkerboard pattern. If you need to chill it for longer than 1 hour, make sure you let it sit at room temperature for 15-30 minutes before continuing with the next step.",

Then cut each strip into thirds again. You\u2019ll have 9 thin strips from each dough block. My strips are usually a little uneven and messy, so for a neat checkerboard pattern, I always trim off* any rounded edges. Place 1 mint dough strip on your work surface. Line up a chocolate dough strip next to it. Line up a mint dough strip next to that. Top each with a row of alternating flavored dough strips, then top that with another row of alternating dough strips. Repeat with 2nd block, starting with a chocolate dough strip this time. As you\u2019re working, press the strips tightly together to rid any gaps. (This is why it\u2019s important the doughs are still a bit soft and pliable.)

I use and recommend unsulphured or dark molasses. (I like Grandma\u2019s brand. The kind I use is labeled \u201coriginal\u201d molasses.) Blackstrap molasses is extremely bitter and not ideal in this recipe.",
      "Spices in Filling: You only want a small pinch of each spice in the filling. I recommend half of 1/8 teaspoon, which is 1/16 teaspoon. Feel free to add only a little of each, taste after beating the filling ingredients together, then beat in more of any spice if desired. I usually go a little heavier on the cinnamon."

    "ingredients": [
      "2 and 1/4 cups (281g) all-purpose flour\u00a0(spooned & leveled), plus more as needed for rolling and work surface",
      "1/2 teaspoon baking powder",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt",
      "3/4 cup (12 Tbsp; 170g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
      "3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar",
      "1 large egg, at room temperature",
      "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
      "15\u201320 unwrapped hard candies, such as Jolly Ranchers or Life Savers",
      "1 large egg white OR 2 Tablespoons (30ml) water",
      "1/3 cup (65g) coarse sugar or sprinkles"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
      "In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.",
      "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.",
      "Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness or slightly thinner (anywhere between 1/8 \u2013 1/4 inch is fine). Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly thick.",
      "Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days.",
      "As the cookie dough chills, begin crushing the candies. The best way to crush the hard candies is to separate them by color, place each color in plastic bags, and crush them with a rolling pin or meat mallet. Don\u2019t crush the candies into a fine powder\u2014crush them into fine pebble-sized bits. The crushed candies will pierce the bag no matter how careful you are. Some candy dust will escape, so just know that this step is messy. If you don\u2019t want to use plastic, use a paper bag or paper plate. (A bag is preferred so candy doesn\u2019t go flying everywhere.) Set crushed candy aside.",
      "Once cookie dough has chilled, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it\u2019s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it\u2014see me do this in the video above. Using your large cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Using your small cookie cutter, cut out the center shape. (You don\u2019t need the center piece\u2014re-roll it!) Re-roll all the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd piece of dough. Note: It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.",
      "Carefully arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. If your cookies are intricately shaped, use two hands to transfer them to the lined baking sheet.",
      "Optional Topping: If using an egg white, beat it lightly with a fork or small whisk for 10 seconds. It\u2019s easier to brush onto tops of cookies if it\u2019s beaten first. Brush tops of shaped cookies with egg white or water. Sprinkle coarse sugar/sprinkles on top.",
      "Fill Cookie Centers: Fill the cut-out centers about 3/4 full with crushed candies. The candy pieces melt and expand, so you don\u2019t need to over-fill. I use and recommend 1 color per cookie, but feel free to mix for a spotty multicolor look. The candies are sticky, so wipe off your fingers as needed.",
      "Bake for 12-13 minutes or until candies have melted and the cookies are lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet until the melted candy center sets, about 15 minutes. Once melted candy center has set, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Cover and store cookies at room temperature for up to 1 week. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: Sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. After candy center cools and sets, layer the cookies between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 3, divide in half, flatten both halves into a disk as we do with pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the disks in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4, then chill rolled out dough in the refrigerator for 45 minutes \u2013 1 hour before cutting into shapes and baking.",
      "Optional Topping: In the pictured cookies, I used an egg white and white sparkling sugar sprinkles, something you can usually find in the baking aisle at the grocery store. (I like Wilton brand.) The egg white created a lovely golden sheen. If you use water, the cookies may look a little pale in comparison.",

      "Room Temperature:\u00a0Room temperature butter\u00a0is essential. If the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. Room temperature egg is preferred so it\u2019s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie dough.",

After ridding some moisture, you\u2019ll have a little less than 1 and 1/2 cups of pumpkin\u2014I usually have about 1 and 1/3 cups (315g). Using anywhere between 1.33 \u2013 1.5 cups of pumpkin is fine. Set aside until step 4. Or cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. It can be cold when you add it to the dough.",

Add the egg and mix on high until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Add the maple syrup and vanilla and mix on high until combined.",
      "Add the dry ingredients and the zucchini to the wet ingredients, then mix on low speed until combined. With the mixer still running on low speed, beat in the chocolate chips. Cover and chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours (and up to 4 days). If chilling for longer than a few hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.",
      "Scoop or roll cookie dough, a heaping 1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie (I like to use this medium cookie scoop), and place 3 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 13-14 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look very soft. For crispier edges, bake for 15 minutes.",
      "Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. While the cookies are still warm, I like to press a few more chocolate chips into the tops\u2013 this is only for looks! Cookies are extra soft out of the oven, but become chewier as they cool.",

Give the Oreos a very rough chop into bite-sized pieces as pictured above. Or break them up by hand. Chopping into finer pieces creates a lot of dark sandy crumbs.

To ensure a thicker cookie, make the balls taller than they are wide (almost like a cylinder or column). Arrange 2-3 inches apart on the baking sheets. The cookie dough is certainly sticky, so wipe your hands clean after every few balls of dough you shape.",

Tip: If they aren\u2019t really spreading by minute 9, remove them from the oven and lightly bang the baking sheet on the counter 2-3x. This helps initiate that spread. Return to the oven to continue baking.",

      "Add an open star piping tip (I recommend Wilton 1M) to your piping bag (disposable or reusable). Drizzle any leftover chocolate along the inside of your piping bag (this is optional). Add the meringue batter. It won\u2019t all fit, so only use half to start.",
      "Pipe 1.5 inch swirls until you use up all the batter. See the video tutorial above if you need a visual. The cookies don\u2019t spread, so you can pipe them just 1-2 inches apart. Top each with sprinkles, if desired.",
      "Bake for 1 and 1/2 hours. (You can bake both baking sheets at once.) Do not open the oven as the meringues bake. Turn off the oven after 1.5 hours and let the meringues sit inside as the oven cools for 30 minutes or until the oven has cooled completely.",

You can use semi-sweet, bittersweet, or even milk chocolate. Do not use chocolate chips, as they contain stabilizers preventing them from melting into the proper consistency.",
      "Egg Whites: For best success, I recommend using fresh eggs instead of carton egg whites. Here are all my recipes using leftover egg yolks. Eggs separate much easier when they\u2019re cold, but room temperature egg whites whip into a higher volume. Separate the eggs right out of the refrigerator, then let the egg whites sit for about 30 minutes before starting. Separate the egg whites one at a time and place the egg white in the mixing bowl before separating the next. This way, if a yolk breaks in one of them, you don\u2019t waste the whole batch.",

      "Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl. Set aside.",
      "In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and 1/3 cup (67g) granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and peppermint extract and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, add the milk, and mix on low until combined. The cookie dough will be thick.",
      "Roll balls of dough, a little less than 1 Tablespoon each (about 1 inch balls), and roll each into remaining 1/3 cup (67g) granulated sugar. Place dough balls onto a large lined baking sheet. Using your thumb or the end of a spatula (see post above), make an indent into each cookie. If you find that the balls are cracking when you make an indent, use your hands to push back together. (Some cracks are bound to happen as the cookies expand in the oven\u2014see my photos. No worries there!)",
      "Chill the shaped cookies for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator or 1 hour in the freezer (or up to 4 days in the refrigerator). Cover them if chilling for longer than 3 hours.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Remove chilled and shaped cookies from the refrigerator. Divide between both baking sheets, spacing the cookies about 2-3 inches apart. This recipe yields about 30 cookies, so you\u2019ll have a 3rd batch with only a few cookies on the sheet.",
      "Bake for 12-14 minutes or until the edges are set. The cookies will still look and feel a little soft. Remove from the oven. The indents will have lost some shape or have puffed up, so use the end of a spatula to make an indent again into the warm cookies.",
      "Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before filling with ganache.",
      "For the ganache: Place chocolate into a heat-proof bowl. Heat the cream in a small saucepan until it begins to gently simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil\u2014that\u2019s too hot!) Pour over chocolate and let it sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften the chocolate. Slowly stir until completely combined and chocolate has melted. Stir in the peppermint extract. Taste and add another drop if desired. (It\u2019s potent so don\u2019t go overboard!) Allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before spooning into cookies.",
      "Spoon 1/2 \u2013 1 teaspoon of ganache into each indentation. I fit about 3/4 teaspoon into each. Sprinkle ganache with crushed candy canes. Ganache will thicken inside the cookies and set on the tops after a few hours, but will still be creamy when you bite into the cookies.",
      "Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Store any leftover ganache in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can make and shape the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, as noted in step 4. Baked and filled (or unfilled) cookies freeze well for up to 3 months.

      "Read through the recipe and recipe Notes before beginning. Make room in your refrigerator for a baking sheet so the shaped cookies can chill for 20\u201330 minutes. Without chilling, the piped cookies may over-spread. If you chill the dough prior to shaping, the dough will be too cold/stiff to pipe.",
      "Line 2\u20133 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats, or leave unlined. If unlined, do not grease the pan.",
      "In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract, and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.",
      "On low speed, beat in the flour and salt. Turn up to high speed and beat until completely combined. On medium speed, beat in 1.5 Tablespoons of milk. You want a dough that\u2019s creamy and pipe-able (but still thick), so you may need up to 2\u20132.5 Tablespoons of milk. The more milk you add, the more the cookies will spread, so chilling in step 6 is imperative. I recommend keeping the amount of milk small and using a large enough piping tip, like the ones I suggest in the post above.",
      "Add your large piping tip to the piping bag. Spoon a little bit of dough into the piping bag and pipe a 1\u20132-inch swirl or line on the prepared baking sheet. The reason I suggest only a little bit of dough to start is because the dough may still be too thick to pipe. If it\u2019s too thick, transfer that dough back to the mixing bowl and add another 1/2 Tablespoon of milk. If the dough is creamy enough to pipe, continue piping the dough in 1\u20132-inch swirls or lines, 3 inches apart on the baking sheet. See video for a visual if needed. If desired, place a maraschino cherry in the center of the swirl or sprinkle the dough with sprinkles and/or coarse sugar.",
      "Transfer the baking sheet to the refrigerator and chill the shaped cookies for 20\u201330 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).",
      "Bake the chilled cookies for 12\u201315 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The cookies will spread like all cookies do, but not completely lose their shape, especially if you chilled the shaped dough. If the cookies are smaller, they will take closer to 12 minutes. Keep your eye on them. They\u2019re done when the edges lightly brown.",
      "Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "Optional Chocolate: You can melt the chocolate in a\u00a0double boiler or the microwave. If using the microwave: place the chopped chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl. Melt in 20-second increments in the microwave, stirring after each increment until completely melted and smooth. Dip the cookies in chocolate and top with sprinkles, if desired. Allow the chocolate to set completely at room temperature for about 1 hour or in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.",
      "Plain cookies stay fresh in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. Cookies with chocolate or cherries stay fresh in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 days or in the refrigerator for 1 week."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: You can chill the shaped cookies on the baking sheet in the refrigerator for up to 2 days before baking. If chilling for longer than 30 minutes, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Sometimes I pipe all the swirls close together on 1 baking sheet, then refrigerate for up to 2 days. (Since my refrigerator can\u2019t fit 2-3 sheets at once.) After chilling, the shaped dough is cold, so you can use a flat spatula to pick up the cold shaped dough and arrange on 2-3 baking sheets. You can also freeze the un-baked shaped dough for up to 2-3 months. Bake the frozen shaped dough (no need to thaw) for an extra couple minutes. Baked cookies, with or without chocolate/cherries/sprinkles, freeze well for up to 3 months.",

      "Almond Extract: Almond extract adds such a wonderful flavor and I don\u2019t recommend skipping it. If desired, you can leave it out completely or add another 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract in its place. You can also substitute with 3/4 teaspoon peppermint extract, 1 teaspoon lemon extract, or another flavor extract you enjoy. (Some are more potent than others.) Adding 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon is delicious too!",
      "No Piping Tip & Using a Cookie Press: This recipe is similar to my spritz cookies where I use a cookie press. If you don\u2019t have a large piping tip and/or you want to use a cookie press, make the spritz cookies (they do not need the milk). If you don\u2019t have a cookie press or large piping tip, snip a 1/2 inch corner off the end of a plastic bag and pipe lines/flat swirls.",
      "Optional Chocolate: For the best results, use a 4 ounce \u201cbaking chocolate\u201d bar found in the baking aisle. I prefer Bakers or Ghirardelli brands. You can use semi-sweet, milk chocolate, or even white chocolate. Candy melts or almond bark work too. Do not use chocolate chips, as they contain stabilizers preventing them from melting into the proper consistency. After you melt it, if the chocolate is too thick for dipping, stir in 1 teaspoon of canola oil to help thin it out."

You can even reduce the apple cider the day ahead of time. Cover and refrigerate overnight, then bring to room temperature before using.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.",
      "Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt together in a large bowl. In another large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together on medium-high speed until creamed, about 1 minute. Add the oil, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract and beat on high speed until combined, about 1-2 minutes. The mixture will look curdled as a result of the varying textures trying to combine. This is OK and it will come together when you add the dry ingredients. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.",
      "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, pour in the 1/2 cup of reduced apple cider, then mix on low until completely combined. Batter will be thick and creamy.",
      "Using a medium cookie scoop, scoop mounds of batter, about 1 and 1/2 Tablespoons each, onto prepared baking sheets about 3 inches apart. If desired, sprinkle each with cinnamon sugar. See recipe note.",
      "Bake the cookies for 12-14 minutes or until the edges are very lightly browned and the tops spring back when lightly touched. Mine usually take 13 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Make the filling as they cool.",
      "Make the filling: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, apple cider, and vanilla extract, then beat on medium speed until combined. Taste. Add a pinch of salt if desired (I always do). Add another Tablespoon of apple cider if needed to thin out or more spices if desired for extra flavor.",

      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Frosting can be made 2 days in advance, covered, and stored in the refrigerator until ready to use. The frosting will be quite thick after refrigerating, so beat it with a mixer and add another Tablespoon of apple cider or even milk if needed to thin out. You can prepare the whoopie pie cookie batter, cover it tightly, and refrigerate for up to 1 day. Let it come to room temperature, then bake as directed. You can freeze the baked and filled whoopie pies for up to 3 months. Wrap them individually with plastic wrap and place in a large freezer container.

      "Apple Cider: Use apple cider, not apple juice. The apple cider is reduced down for the cookie batter in step 1. I just use regular apple cider (not reduced) for the filling, though you could reduce down extra for the filling if desired.",
      "Cinnamon Sugar Topping: I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on each mound of cookie dough before baking. This gave the whoopie pies an extra delicious punch of flavor. Mix 2 Tablespoons of granulated sugar with 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Sprinkle a little onto each mound of cookie dough before baking.",

Do not use pumpkin pie filling.",
      "Pumpkin Pie Spice:\u00a0You can find pumpkin pie spice in the baking aisle of most grocery stores or make your own homemade pumpkin pie spice. If you don\u2019t have either and want to use individual spices, use 1/4 teaspoon each: ground ginger, ground nutmeg, ground cloves, and ground allspice. This is in addition to the 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon\u2014you will still add that.",
      "Chilled Dough: If you are chilling the pumpkin cookie dough for longer than 30 minutes, the cookie dough will likely have to sit on the counter at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before scooping/rolling because it will be quite cold and solid. The amount of time it needs to sit at room temperature depends on how long the dough has chilled. If I chill my cookie dough for around 24 hours, I let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.",

      "Freezing Instructions:\u00a0Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out.

      "Flavors:\u00a0I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as listed in the ingredients above. For lighter flavor, use 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the almond extract, try using 1 teaspoon of maple extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, or peppermint extract. Or add 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground cinnamon.

      "Maple Syrup: Avoid \u201cbreakfast syrup\u201d which doesn\u2019t have the same robust maple flavor that pure syrup contains. Grade A is good, but Grade B is darker and more flavorful because it\u2019s produced later in the season. You can\u2019t go wrong with either in these cookies.",

Typically, if a recipe calls for room temperature or melted butter, it\u2019s in good practice to use room temperature eggs as well. To bring eggs to room temperature quickly, simply place the whole eggs in a glass of warm water for 5-10 minutes. What to do with the extra egg white? Here are all my recipes using egg whites.",
      "Will This Recipe Work for Regular Size Cookies? Yes! For 24 regular size cookies, measure out a heaping 1.5 Tablespoons of cookie dough per cookie and bake at 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C) for about 12-13 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides."

Nothing will be added to it. Set vanilla dough aside. The other two portions will be your strawberry dough and chocolate dough.",
      "Make the strawberry dough: Place one portion of dough back into the mixing bowl. Add all of the strawberry dough ingredients. I recommend starting with 1 drop of red or pink food coloring. Beat on low speed until dough is combined. Add another drop or 2 of food coloring until you reach the pink color desired. For the pictured cookies, I only used 1 drop of dusty rose gel food coloring.\u00a0Remove from the mixing bowl.\u00a0No need to rinse out the mixing bowl.",
      "Make the chocolate dough: Place last portion of dough back into the mixing bowl. Add all of the chocolate dough ingredients. Beat on low speed until dough is combined.",
      "Shape and chill cookie dough:\u00a0See step-by-step photos above showing this following step so you have a better understanding. Line a 9\u00d75 inch loaf pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the chilled cookie dough out. I recommend layering the cookie dough into the pan in the following order: strawberry dough on the bottom, vanilla dough in the middle, chocolate dough on top. Using your hands, press each dough layer firmly and evenly into prepared loaf pan.",
      "Cover loaf pan tightly and chill dough in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours (and up to 4 days) or 1 hour in the freezer. (See make ahead tip if you wish to freeze longer.)",

      "Slice and bake:\u00a0Lift dough out of the pan using the overhang of parchment paper on the sides. You\u2019ll have a 9\u00d75 inch block of dough. Slice in half lengthwise so you have two 2.5 x 9 inch rectangles. Use a sharp knife to trim off the ends so the rectangles are 8 inches long. Slice each into 16 cookies. Each cookie is 1/2 inch thick. Trim the cookie edges to make neat rectangles, if desired.*",

Thaw overnight in the refrigerator then continue with step 9.",
      "Eggs: You need 1 egg plus an additional egg yolk for the cookie dough. Save the extra egg white and mix it with 1 Tablespoon of water to make a simple egg wash. Brush this over each cookie as directed in step 11, then sprinkle with coarse sugar before baking. This gives the cookies a little extra crunch and sparkle!",
      "Food Coloring: I recommend using gel food coloring in the strawberry dough instead of liquid food coloring. Liquid food coloring may alter the texture of the finished cookie. Start with 1 drop as directed in step 5, then add another drop or 2 if desired. For the pictured cookies, I only used 1 drop of dusty rose gel food coloring.",
      "Almond Extract: Almond extract adds a lovely flavor to the strawberry cookie dough. If desired, you can leave it out.",
      "Strawberry Extract: Strawberry extract is highly recommended for added strawberry flavor. You can find it in the spice aisle of most major grocery stores.",
      "Freeze-Dried Strawberries Instead?\u00a0Many readers have asked about adding freeze-dried strawberry powder to the strawberry cookie dough. I don\u2019t suggest this. When I tried it, the strawberry cookie dough spread all over while the other layers stayed put. The cookies were very lopsided. It\u2019s the texture of the ground freeze-dried strawberries. So, unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t work as nicely as the jam/flour/strawberry extract.",
      "Neat Rectangles: In step 10, I recommend trimming the sliced cookie edges to make neat rectangles. This is completely optional. You\u2019ll have some leftover cookie dough scraps. Discard or roll it out using a rolling pin and cut into shapes. Bake as directed in this recipe.",
      "Dipped Neapolitan Cookies:\u00a0You need 1 ounce of semi-sweet chocolate for the chocolate cookie dough and most baking chocolate is sold in 4 ounce bars. I recommend Bakers or Ghirardelli brands, both sold in the baking aisle. Melt the remaining 3 ounces of chocolate from that bar, plus an extra 4 ounce bar for a total of 7 ounces of melted semi-sweet chocolate. Make sure you chop the bars before melting.\u00a0Melt in a double boiler or in the microwave in 15-second increments, stopping and stirring after each until completely smooth. Dip the corner of each cooled cookie into melted chocolate.\u00a0Allow chocolate to set completely in the refrigerator for 20 minutes or at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
      "Fun with Flavors:\u00a0Spruce up the vanilla layer with 1/2 cup crushed walnuts or 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract. Switch out raspberry jam and extract for the strawberry. Add a pinch of espresso powder to the chocolate dough for a mocha flavor."

If you can\u2019t find almond flour in the store, you can make your own by simply pulsing almonds until they reach a gritty and rough flour-like consistency. Instead of almond flour, you can use the same amount of oat flour. (Buy oat flour or pulse whole oats into a flour.) All-purpose flour isn\u2019t ideal because the cookies will not spread or caramelize. Some readers have used coconut flour, but note that the taste and texture is off. I strongly recommend almond flour.",
      "Either 1 Tablespoon of milk or corn syrup works in this lace cookie recipe. You need a liquid and the resulting cookie tastes exactly the same no matter which you choose. I prefer corn syrup because I find it makes the cookies just a *little* crispier.",
      "Nutella can get a little messy, so if you\u2019re gifting or traveling with the lace cookies\u2013 I suggest using melted chocolate for sandwiching the cookies. Unlike Nutella, melted chocolate will set. Instead of sandwiching, try dunking the cookies in melted chocolate or drizzling the chocolate on top. Whichever way you prefer, use about 6-8 ounces of chopped semi-sweet chocolate. (I like Ghirardelli or Bakers brand, both found in the baking aisle.) Melt the chopped chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave in 15-second increments, stopping and stirring after each until completely smooth. Sandwich, dip, or drizzle onto cooled cookies. Allow chocolate to set completely in the refrigerator for 20 minutes or at room temperature for 30 minutes."

Everything can be prepared in advance, see my make ahead tip after the recipe instructions. House structure must completely set for at least 4-6 hours before decorating.",
    "ingredients": [
      "3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)",
      "1/4 teaspoon baking soda",
      "2 teaspoons ground ginger",
      "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
      "1/2 teaspoon ground allspice",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt",
      "6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
      "3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar",
      "1 large egg, at room temperature",
      "1/2 cup (120ml) unsulphured or dark molasses (do not use blackstrap; I prefer Grandma\u2019s brand)",

      "2 Tablespoons (30ml) milk",
      "1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "1/8 teaspoon salt"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Print out my\u00a0Sally\u2019s Baking Recipes Gingerbread House Template and cut out the shapes. Set aside for step 6.",
      "Make the cookie dough: Whisk the flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.",
      "In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat\u00a0in the egg, molasses, and water on high speed. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. On low speed, slowly mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until combined. Cookie dough will be very thick.",
      "Divide cookie dough in half, flatten into discs (about 4-5 inches in diameter), and wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours or up to 3 days.",
      "Preheat oven to\u00a0350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.",
      "Cut into shapes: Remove each disc from the refrigerator and roll each out in between two pieces of parchment paper. Watch me do this in the video above\u2013 gingerbread cookie dough will stick to your counter no matter how much you flour it. Parchment is best. Roll out to about 1/4 inch thick. You want thick pieces for your gingerbread house. Lightly flour the underside of gingerbread house template shapes. (The dough is sticky and the paper may stick to it otherwise.) Using a pizza cutter or small knife, carefully cut the dough into the gingerbread house template shapes. You will need TWO of each shape. Re-roll dough scraps so you have enough dough for the whole house. Use any extra dough to create fun shapes using cookie cutters. I made a few gingerbread stars!",
      "Carefully arrange gingerbread house shapes onto prepared baking sheets, about 3 inches apart. If they lost some of their shape transferring to the baking sheet, straighten out the edges (see my video above).",
      "Bake house pieces for about 18-20 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Bake chimney pieces for about 12-13 minutes or until edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven and allow shapes to cool completely on the baking sheets or on the counter. A flat surface is KEY for cooling\u2013 the gingerbread house edges very slightly curl up otherwise. Cooled gingerbread house pieces can be made up to 1 week in advance, cover tightly and store at room temperature or in the refrigerator. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months, thaw at room temperature before using.",
      "Construct the base of the house:\u00a0Select a base for your gingerbread house. I used a wooden cake server. Watch my video above to guide you through constructing the house. Start with two pieces: the front of the house and 1 side. Using a squeeze bottle, run a thick line of royal icing on one long edge and one short edge of the side of the house piece. Stick it to your base. Use whatever you have around the house to help it stand up. You can see in my video that I use snack bag clips. You can also prop it up with soda cans, a tall cup, water bottle, etc. Run a line of royal icing along the bottom of the front of the house piece. Stick it to your base, adhering it to the side of the house piece. Hold the two in place for a few minutes until the icing is partially set, propping them up as necessary. Repeat with the 2nd side of the house piece and back of the house piece. Pipe royal icing inside any seams, inside and outside of the house, to fill any voids. Don\u2019t be afraid to go heavy on the royal icing \u201cglue\u201d \u2014 when it dries, it looks like snow! Allow it to set at room temperature for at least 1 hour before adding the roof pieces.",
      "Add the roof:\u00a0The roof pieces will be placed on top of the house base. Run a thick line of royal icing on the inside edges of one of the roof pieces and adhere it to the base. Hold in place for a few minutes. Repeat with 2nd roof piece. Run a thick line of royal icing where the two roof pieces meet at the top of the house. Hold in place for a few minutes.",
      "Optional Chimney:\u00a0The chimney is optional, but it\u2019s a lot of fun. I recommend putting together the chimney separately, then adhering to the roof. It\u2019s easiest to glue the chimney pieces together upside-down. Use thick lines of royal icing to assemble the chimney in the same way you put together the base of the house. (Except you\u2019re not adhering it to a base because it\u2019s going on the roof!) Allow icing to set by propping it up as necessary. Once set, adhere onto the roof. The chimney may not fit to the exact angle of the roof because both puffed up or lost some shape during baking and cooling, so use as much royal icing as necessary and you can cover any bare spots with buttercream during decoration.",
      "House must set: Before decorating, the icing on the entire house must completely set. Allow the entire house to set at room temperature for at least 3 hours, preferably 4-6 hours or even overnight before decorating. Cover and store leftover royal icing at room temperature or in the refrigerator during this time. It will be the glue for adhering candies to the house.",
      "Prepare the buttercream:\u00a0Buttercream can be prepared up to 1 day in advance\u2013 cover tightly and store in the refrigerator overnight. Bring to room temperature before piping/decorating.\u00a0With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the shortening and butter together on medium speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, milk, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes. Frosting will be very thick, which is what you want. If much too thick, add another splash of milk. Add a pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. (I add 1/8 teaspoon salt.)",
      "Use buttercream, leftover royal icing, and candies for decorating. See my candy suggestions in the blog post above. I only used 1 piping tip for the entire house: Ateco piping tip #32. This is a small open star piping tip and you can watch me use it in the video above. Makes a lovely design.",
      "Don\u2019t forget to chow down on your beautiful creation if you\u2019re in the mood for eating it. Use your best judgment here, obviously the food will taste old after a few days!"
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions:\u00a0Royal icing can be prepared the day before, see recipe note below. Crusting buttercream can also be made the day before, see step 13. Cookie dough can be made up to 3 days in advance, see step 4. Baked and cooled house pieces can be made up to 1 week in advance or frozen for up to 3 months, see step 8. House can be completely constructed up to 1 day in advance, see step 12.",

      "Recipe Yield: One gingerbread house\u00a0plus 6-8 3-inch cookies. Gingerbread house is about 7 inches tall (with chimney) and 6 inches wide.",
      "Royal Icing: Decide how much royal icing you want to use. I suggest making the entire royal icing recipe so you have plenty for constructing and decorating. You can make the royal icing the day before\u2013 cover and store at room temperature or in the refrigerator overnight. Let it come to room temperature before using. You can freeze leftover royal icing (instructions in that recipe) or use it to decorate Christmas cookies. As you can see in these photos, I covered the roof with royal icing before piping the buttercream on top. (Let the royal icing dry before adding the buttercream on top.) As the royal icing dried, it gently dripped off the sides and looked like snow!",
      "Shortening: Shortening is what makes this buttercream \u201ccrust\u201d or \u201cset\u201d after a couple hours. If you want a sticky buttercream, you can replace the shortening with unsalted butter."

Hold the cookie press perpendicular to the cold lined baking sheet and press out the cookies 2 inches (5 cm) apart. If desired, decorate the shaped cookie dough with sprinkles or press a chocolate chip into the center.

      "Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the cake layers are lightly brown on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean.\u00a0Allow cakes to cool for 10 minutes in the pans. Run a sharp knife around the edges, then carefully invert the pan so the warm cookie cake slides out. (At this point you can clean out pans, grease, line with parchment, grease parchment, then bake remaining cakes if needed.)\u00a0Set the baked cakes on a wire rack to cool completely. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Make the frosting:\u00a0\u00a0With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and peanut butter together on medium speed until creamy and smooth, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, and 1 Tablespoon milk. Mix on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. Add another Tablespoon or 2 of milk if frosting is too thick. Taste and add a pinch of salt if needed. (I always add a pinch!)",
      "Assemble and decorate: Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Continue layering the cake layers and frosting. Spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides, if there\u2019s any leftover for the sides! If desired, top with chocolate chips. Slice and serve.",

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions:\u00a0The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Let the frosting sit at room temperature to slightly soften for 10 minutes before assembling and frosting. Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving.",

When the cake layers are lightly brown on top and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean, they\u2019re done. (1) Make the recipe as directed and bake in three 9-inch cake pans for about 22-25 minutes. (2) Halve the recipe and bake in\u00a0one 9-inch cake pan for about 22-25 minutes. (3) Halve the recipe and bake in three 6-inch cake pans for about 20-22 minutes.",
      "Frosting: If desired, use any of the alternate frosting recipes linked in the post above.",

      "Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Using a spatula, gently fold into egg mixture. I suggest carefully folding in half of the flour mixture, then folding in the other half. (Instead of dumping it all in at once.) Make sure you\u2019re handling this batter with care. It\u2019s very delicate.",
      "Stir 1/4 cup of the batter into the melted butter. It will take a minute to fully incorporate. Then stir it all into the rest of the batter. The batter will be thick, silky, and shiny.",
      "Cover the batter and chill in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes. Try not to chill any longer than this as the butter in the batter will begin to solidify.",
      "During the last few minutes of chilling, preheat the oven to\u00a0350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C).",
      "Melt the remaining 2 Tablespoons butter. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the pan with melted butter. I find that greasing the pan is necessary even if you\u2019re using a nonstick pan. We want to avoid any chance of sticking.",
      "The batter will be quite airy and spongey after resting. This is good! Do not try to deflate it.\u00a0Spoon 1 generous Tablespoon of batter into the center of each scalloped well. No need to spread it to the edges. Just plop it in the center. (Cover and refrigerate remaining batter if you do not have 2 madeleine pans to bake the batter all at once.)",
      "Bake for 10-12 minutes. The madeleines are done when the tops spring back after lightly pressed with your finger. Invert the pan onto the counter. Transfer the warm madeleines to a wire rack to lightly cool.",

They dry out very quickly; I find baked and covered madeleines lose their texture even after 1 day! For this reason, I don\u2019t recommend freezing them either. You\u2019ll lose a lot of texture."

      "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. If the dough seems too soft, you can add 1 Tablespoon more flour until it is a better consistency for rolling.",
      "Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Roll each portion out onto a piece of parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat (I prefer the nonstick silicone mat) to about 1/4-inch thickness. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick.",
      "Stack the pieces, with parchment paper between the two, onto a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days. If chilling for more than a couple hours, cover the top dough piece with a\u00a0single\u00a0piece of parchment paper.",
      "Once chilled, preheat oven to\u00a0350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Remove one of the dough pieces from the refrigerator and\u00a0cut into shapes with cookie cutter(s). Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd\u00a0dough piece.",
      "Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes, until lightly browned around the edges. Make sure you rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before\u00a0decorating.\u00a0I like to decorate cookies directly on baking sheets so I can stick the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help set the icing. So place the cooled cookies back on baking sheets.",
      "Decorate with royal icing.",
      "Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending. Plain or decorated cookies stay soft for about 5 days when covered tightly at room temperature. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions:\u00a0Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 3, divide in half, flatten both halves into a disk as we do with\u00a0pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the disks in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4, then chill as directed in step 5\u2013 no need to chill for 1-2 hours, 45 minutes should be plenty.",
      "Almond Extract: I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as listed in the ingredients above. For lighter flavor, use 1/4 teaspoon.",

    "ingredients": [
      "2 and 1/4 cups (281g) all-purpose flour\u00a0(spooned & leveled), plus more as needed for rolling and work surface",
      "1/2 teaspoon baking powder",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt",
      "3/4 cup (12 Tbsp; 170g) unsalted\u00a0butter, softened to room temperature",
      "3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar",
      "1 large egg, at room temperature",
      "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
      "1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon\u00a0almond extract\u00a0(optional, but makes the flavor outstanding)*",
      "Royal Icing",
      "red, black, and orange gel food coloring"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
      "In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extract (if using) and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.",
      "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.",
      "Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick.",
      "Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days.",
      "Once chilled, preheat oven to\u00a0350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it\u2019s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it. Using a snowman cookie cutter, cut into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd\u00a0dough piece of dough.\u00a0(Note: It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.)",
      "Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes, until lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before\u00a0decorating.",
      "Decorate:\u00a0Prepare Royal Icing.\u00a0You\u2019ll need 3 small bowls: one for red icing, one for black icing, and one for orange icing. Spoon 1/4 cup of icing into each bowl. The rest of the icing will remain white. Stir red food coloring into 1 bowl until you reach your desired shade. Stir black food coloring into another bowl until you reach your desired shade. (I find that black always dries darker so stop adding coloring when you reach a dark gray.) Finally, stir orange food coloring into the last bowl until you reach your desired shade.",
      "Fit a piping bag (reusable or disposable) with\u00a0Wilton piping tip #5 or piping tip #4. If you only have 1 of these piping tips, keep the tip on the outside of the bag by using a coupler so you can easily transfer the piping tip to the bag of red icing because you need the same tip for the red scarf. Spoon white icing inside the piping bag. Decorate cookies with white icing by piping a border around the edges and then filling it. (Leave room for the black hat!) Allow to set. I put the baking sheet in the refrigerator to speed it up.",
      "Meanwhile, fill more piping bags with remaining colors of icing. You need Wilton piping tip #1 for the black hat, eyes, mouth, and button. You also need it for the orange icing, so if you only have 1 tip, use a\u00a0coupler so you can easily transfer the piping tip to the bag of orange icing. You need\u00a0Wilton piping tip #5 or piping tip #4 for the red scarf.",
      "Once the white icing sets, pipe the scarf with red icing. Then pipe the hat, eyes, and buttons with black icing. Pipe the nose with orange icing.",
      "Icing will completely set in about 2-3 hours at room temperature. Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending. Plain or decorated cookies stay soft for about 5 days when covered tightly at room temperature. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions:\u00a0Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 3, divide in half, flatten both halves into a disk as we do with\u00a0pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the disks in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4, then chill as directed in step 5\u2014no need to chill for 1-2 hours, 45 minutes should be plenty.",

      "Flavors:\u00a0I love flavoring this cookie dough with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract as listed in the ingredients above. For lighter flavor, use 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of the almond extract, try using 1 teaspoon of maple extract, coconut extract, lemon extract, or peppermint extract. Or add 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice or ground cinnamon. If using lemon extract, you can also add 1 Tablespoon lemon zest.",
      "Snowflake Sugar Cookies: I used this snowflake cookie cutter, the Wilton #4 piping tip, a big blue sprinkle bead\u00a0in the center, and sprinkled\u00a0white sparkling sugar on top.",
      "Room Temperature:\u00a0Room temperature butter\u00a0is essential. If the dough is too sticky, your butter may have been too soft. Room temperature butter is actually cool to the touch. Room temperature egg is preferred so it\u2019s quickly and evenly mixed into the cookie dough.",

      "Watermelon Flavor: The watermelon flavoring is pretty similar to the flavor of a watermelon jolly rancher. It\u2019s tasty, but if that\u2019s not your thing, try using 1 teaspoon of either lemon or orange extract instead. You can find those in the baking aisle of any major grocery store."

Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.",
      "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour.",
      "Roll the dough: Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Dust 2 large pieces of parchment paper or 2 silicone baking mats with cocoa powder or flour. Place a dough half on each. With a rolling pin lightly dusted with cocoa powder or flour, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more cocoa powder/flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick.",
      "Chill the dough: Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with cocoa powder or flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days.",
      "Preheat oven & shape cookies: Once chilled, preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. Using cookie cutters, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough, using more cocoa powder or flour to lightly dust your work surface and rolling pin, and continue cutting the dough until all is used. Work quickly so the dough doesn\u2019t become too warm or soft. If it does, stop what you\u2019re doing and place any unused dough back in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to stiffen up again. Repeat cutting into shapes with 2nd half of dough. (Note: It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.)",
      "Bake & cool: Arrange shaped cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until edges are set. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating.",
      "Make either icing: Prepare the royal icing or cookie icing and decorate the cooled cookies however you\u2019d like. Add sprinkles on top of the icing if desired. Feel free to tint either icing with gel food coloring. See post above for recommended decorating tools. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it\u2019s helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you can stick the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help speed up the icing setting.",
      "Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending. Plain or decorated cookies stay soft for about 5 days when covered tightly at room temperature. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: Plain or decorated sugar cookies freeze well up to 3 months. Wait for the icing to set completely before layering between sheets of parchment paper in a freezer-friendly container. To thaw, thaw in the refrigerator or at room temperature. You can also freeze the cookie dough for up to 3 months before rolling it out. Prepare the dough through step 2, divide in half, flatten both halves into a disk as we do with pie crust, wrap each in plastic wrap, then freeze. To thaw, thaw the disks in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature for about 1 hour. Roll out the dough as directed in step 4, then chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour before cutting into shapes and baking.",

      "1 cup (226g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
      "1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar",
      "1 cup (200g) packed light or dark brown sugar",

      "In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter for 1 minute on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy. Add the granulated sugar and brown sugar and beat on medium high speed until fluffy and light in color. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and vanilla bean seeds on high speed. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.",
      "In a separate bowl,\u00a0whisk the\u00a0flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt together until combined. On low speed, slowly mix into the wet ingredients until combined. The cookie dough will be quite thick. Add the toffee bits, mix on low for about 5-10 seconds until evenly disbursed. Cover dough tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory for this cookie dough.",
      "Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 20 minutes\u2014if the cookie dough chilled longer than 3 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This makes the cookie dough easier to scoop and roll.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.",
      "Once chilled, the dough might\u00a0be slightly crumbly, but will come together if you work the dough with your hands as you roll into individual balls. Scoop and roll balls of dough, about 1 Tablespoon of dough each, into balls. Sprinkle with sea salt.",
      "Bake the cookies for 10 minutes (11 minutes for crispier cookies), until slightly golden brown around the edges. My oven has hot spots and yours may too, so be sure to rotate the pan once during bake time. The baked cookies will look extremely soft in the centers when you remove them from the oven. Allow to cool for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet. If the cookies are too puffy, try gently pressing down on them with the back of a spoon. They will slightly deflate as you let them cool. Transfer to cooling rack to cool completely. Sprinkle with additional sea salt if desired."

If it\u2019s uncontrollably sticky, knead\u00a01 more Tablespoon of flour into the dough. With\u00a0floured hands, divide the dough into two\u00a0and place each half onto a baking sheet. Shape each half\u00a0into an 8-9 inch long roll, patting down until each is about 1/2 inch thick. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the top and sides of each biscotti slab with egg wash.",

      "Process the chopped hazelnuts in a food processor or blender until finely chopped. Alternatively, you can chop them up into smaller pieces with a knife. Set aside. Melt the chocolate in a medium bowl in the microwave (or use a double boiler). The key to melting chocolate in the microwave\u00a0is to do it in small bursts and stir frequently. Chocolate seizes\u00a0so fast, so easily. Melt in 15\u00a0second increments, stirring vigorously with a spoon\u00a0after each increment, until completely melted and smooth. Dip one side of each biscotti cookie in the melted chocolate and immediately sprinkle with the chopped hazelnuts. I do this over the sink to avoid a mess! Use any leftover chocolate to drizzle over the nuts. Place the dipped biscotti back onto the baking sheets and\u00a0allow chocolate to set in the refrigerator or at room temperature, about 30-45 minutes."

    "description": "Brown butter chocolate chip cookies are thick, chewy, and unlike any other chocolate chip cookie. There\u2019s\u00a0as much flavor in one\u00a0of these brown butter chocolate chip cookies as there is in an entire batch of classic chocolate chip cookies!",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup (226g) unsalted butter",
      "1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar",
      "1 cup (200g) packed light or dark brown sugar",
      "1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature",
      "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
      "2 and 1/2 cups (313g) all-purpose flour\u00a0(spooned & leveled)",
      "1 teaspoon cornstarch",
      "1 teaspoon baking soda",
      "1/2 teaspoon salt",
      "2 Tablespoons (30ml)\u00a0milk",
      "1 and 1/2 cups (270g) semi-sweet chocolate chips"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Brown the butter:\u00a0Have a large flat heat-proof baking dish, such as a 9\u00d713 inch pan, handy. Slice the butter into pieces and place in a light-colored skillet. The light colored helps you determine when the butter begins\u00a0browning. Melt the butter over medium heat and stir or whisk constantly. Once melted, the butter will begin to foam. Keep stirring/whisking. After 5-7 minutes, the butter will begin browning and you\u2019ll notice\u00a0lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan. It will have a nutty aroma. See photo above for a visual. Once browned, remove from heat immediately and pour into dish.\u00a0Cover tightly, place in the refrigerator, and chill until solid, about 2-3 hours (or up to 1 day). A large flat dish, as opposed to a bowl, helps the butter solidify quicker.",
      "Remove solid brown butter from the refrigerator and spoon into a large bowl (or the bowl of your stand mixer). Using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the chilled brown butter for 1 minute on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy. Add the granulated sugar and brown sugar and beat on medium high speed until light in color and combined, about 2 minutes. Beat in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract on high speed. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.",
      "In a separate bowl,\u00a0whisk the\u00a0flour, cornstarch, baking soda and salt together until combined. On low speed, slowly mix into the wet ingredients until combined, then beat in the milk on medium speed. The cookie dough will be thick. Add the chocolate chips and\u00a0mix on low for about 5-10 seconds until combined. Cover dough tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and chill for at least 2-3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory for this cookie dough or else the cookies will over-spread.",
      "Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes as you preheat the oven. This makes the cookie dough easier to scoop and roll. (If the cookie dough chilled longer than 3 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.)",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.",
      "Once chilled, the dough may be slightly crumbly, but will come together if you work the dough with your hands as you roll into individual balls. Scoop and roll dough, about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough each (I use this medium cookie scoop), into balls.",
      "Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes until slightly golden brown around the edges. My oven has hot spots and yours may too so be sure to rotate the pan once during bake time. The baked cookies will look soft in the centers when you remove them from the oven. Allow to cool for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet. If the cookies are too puffy, try gently pressing down on them with the back of a spoon. During this time, you can press a few extra chocolate chips into the top of the warm cookies. This is just for looks! The cookies will slightly deflate as you let them cool.",
      "After 5 minutes, transfer cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead Instructions: Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Allow to come to room temperature then continue with step 5. Baked cookies freeze well for up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well for up to 3 months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute, no need to thaw. Read my tips and tricks on how to freeze cookie dough.",
      "Special Tools (affiliate links): Skillet | Electric Mixer (Handheld or Stand) | Baking Sheet | Silicone Baking Mat or Parchment Paper | Medium Cookie Scoop | Cooling Rack\u00a0",
      "Dough Chilling Alternative: Chill the cookie dough as a whole for 1 hour. Then remove from the refrigerator and roll into 1.5 Tablespoon balls, as the recipe suggests before baking. Continue to chill the cookie dough balls for the remaining 2-3 hours (or freeze them as suggested in the last step). Some readers find this easier! If you do this, you do not have to let the cookie dough sit at room temperature in the next step.",
      "Cookie Bars: Use a 9\u00d713-inch pan and bake for 24-28 minutes or until lightly golden brown on top. No need to chill the cookie dough, just chill the brown butter as directed.",

    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",

      "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "1/8 teaspoon salt"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "For the cookies: In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the softened butter for about 1 minute on medium speed. Get it nice and smooth, then add the sugar on medium speed and beat until fluffy and light in color. Beat in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla.

      "In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, cornstarch, and salt together\u00a0until combined.\u00a0With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in 3 different parts. The dough is quite thick and will be a little crumbly at first. But if you keep mixing, the dough will come together. Once combined, gently beat in the\u00a0sprinkles\u00a0on low speed until evenly disbursed. Cover the cookie dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory. Alternatively, you can roll the cookie dough into 1.5 Tablespoon balls and chill on a cookie sheet (covered) and then bake as directed in the next step.",
      "Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator and let sit out at room temperature for at least 15 minutes. If the cookie dough chilled longer than 3 hours, allow to sit at room temperature for 30-40 minutes. This makes it easy to handle, while still keeping a firm texture from chilling. Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C) and line 2 large cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Roll cookie dough into balls, about 1.5 Tablespoons of dough in each ball, and set on cookie sheet\u2013 about 8-9 cookies per sheet. Bake in batches for 11-12 minutes or until the edges are slightly browned. The cookies will still appear very soft in the centers. That\u2019s ok; they\u2019ll set up and become firmer as they cool. Allow the cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for 3 minutes, then move to a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "For the frosting:\u00a0In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy \u2013 about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, cream, vanilla extract, and salt with the mixer running on low. Increase to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes. Add more confectioners\u2019\u00a0sugar if frosting is too thin, more cream if frosting is too thick, or a pinch more of salt if frosting is way too sweet.",
      "Frost the cooled cookies as desired and decorate with more sprinkles. Store cookies\u00a0in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or\u00a0in the refrigerator up to 6."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Freezing Instructions: Unfrosted cookies freeze well. Cookies may be rolled into balls and frozen up to 3 months to bake at a later date. No need to thaw frozen balls of dough before baking; simply bake for an extra minute or two. Read my tips and tricks on how to freeze cookie dough.",
      "Cream of Tartar: Used to react with the baking soda; it cannot be left out. If you\u2019re curious about using baking powder instead of baking soda + cream of tartar, I\u2019m unsure of the exact amount needed to properly leaven the cookies. Update 8/2016: It would be about 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder.",
      "Sprinkles: For the cookie dough, avoid using nonpareil sprinkles (the little balls)\u2013 they bleed their color. You may decorate the frosting with nonpareils (like I did).",
      "Cream: Cream or half-and-half is preferred for creamiest, fluffiest frosting. Keeping that in mind, milk would be an OK substitute if you do not have either on hand.",

You need quick oats, which are more finely ground (and smaller) whole oats. I often only buy old-fashioned (whole oats) from the store.

Room temperature eggs incorporate evenly into your cookie dough, which guarantees a uniform texture in each bite of the cookie cake.

Stick a peanut butter cup into one ball, kind of like a \u201ccradle\u201d as shown above. Top the peanut butter cup with other cookie dough ball and seal down the sides so that the peanut butter cup is securely stuffed inside. Roll the large cookie dough ball in your hands to ensure it\u2019s smooth. Repeat with the rest of the dough and peanut butter cups.",

      "Egg: Room temperature egg is best for the cookies. General rule of thumb: I use for my cookie recipes: when using warm or room temperature butter, I always use room temperature egg as well. To bring egg to room temperature quickly, simply place in a cup of warm water for 5 minutes.",
      "Peanut Butter: Thick, commercial brand peanut butter is preferred. If using natural style, make sure the peanut butter is thick and not oily in the slightest \u2013 which will make your cookie dough thin, slippery, and spread all over the baking sheet even after chilling the cookie dough. You need thick, non-oily peanut butter like Jif or Skippy.",

Add the egg and vanilla extract, and then beat on high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.",
      "In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt together until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour into the wet ingredients. Beat on low until combined. The cookie dough will be quite thick. Switch to high speed and beat in the milk. The cookie dough will be sticky and tacky. Cover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory for this sticky cookie dough.",
      "Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. If the cookie dough chilled longer than 3 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes. This makes the chilled cookie dough easier to scoop and roll.",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended\u00a0for cookies.)\u00a0Set aside.",
      "Scoop and roll dough, a heaping 1.5 Tablespoons of dough each, into balls. Roll each in chopped pecans. Arrange 2-3 inches apart on the baking sheets. The cookie dough is certainly sticky, so wipe your hands clean after every few balls of dough you shape.",
      "Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes or until the edges appear set and the centers still look soft. Tip: If they aren\u2019t really spreading by minute 9, remove them from the oven and lightly bang the baking sheet on the counter 2-3x. This helps initiate that spread. Return to the oven to continue baking.",
      "Cool cookies for 5 minutes on the baking sheet, and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. The cookies will slightly deflate as they cool. Drizzle each with salted caramel.",

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Cookies can be frozen for up to 3 months, with or without caramel. I find it\u2019s best to drizzle with caramel right before serving, though. Unbaked cookie dough balls (before rolling in pecans) will freeze well for up to 3 months. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, preheat the oven, then roll in chopped pecans. Bake as directed. Store any leftover caramel in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Warm the caramel up in the microwave for a few seconds before using in a recipe.",

Cover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory for this sticky cookie dough.",

Tip: The cookie dough is certainly sticky, so wipe your hands clean after every few balls of dough you shape.",

Tip: If they aren\u2019t really spreading by minute 9, remove them from the oven and lightly bang the baking sheet on the counter 2\u20133x. This helps initiate that spread.

I do not recommend crunchy style peanut butter for that same reason. I recommend processed creamy peanut butter such as Jif or Skippy.",

With hundreds of positive reviews from bakers around the world, I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll fall in love with this chocolate chip cookie recipe too. Chilling the cookie dough is imperative and cornstarch makes them extra soft and thick!",

      "3/4 cup (12 Tbsp; 170g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
      "3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar",
      "1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar",
      "1 large egg, at room temperature",
      "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
      "2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)",
      "2 teaspoons cornstarch",
      "1 teaspoon baking soda",
      "1/2 teaspoon salt",
      "1 and 1/4 cup (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, brown sugar, and sugar together on medium speed until combined and creamy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg and vanilla. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.",
      "In a separate bowl, whisk flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt together. Add into the wet ingredients, then beat on low speed until combined. The cookie dough will be slightly thick. On low speed, beat in the chocolate chips.",
      "Cover dough tightly and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 3\u20134 days. Chilling is imperative for this cookie dough.",
      "Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.",
      "Once chilled, the dough will be slightly crumbly, but will come together when you work the dough with your hands. Roll cookie dough, about a heaping 1.5 Tablespoons of dough per cookie (I use this medium-size cookie scoop), and place 3 inches apart on baking sheets.",
      "Bake for 11\u201312 minutes, until barely golden brown around the edges. The cookies will look extremely soft when you remove them from the oven. Cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. If the cookies are too puffy, try gently pressing down on them with the back of a spoon. They will slightly deflate as you let them cool. If desired, while the cookies are still warm, press a few extra chocolate chips into the tops. This is optional, just for looks.",
      "Transfer cookies to a cooling rack to cool completely. Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week."

    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 3\u20134 days. Allow to come to room temperature, then continue with preheating the oven in step 4. Baked cookies freeze well for up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well for up to 3 months.

During this time, you can press a few more butterscotch morsels into the top of the warm cookies\u2014this is just for looks. You can also sprinkle with a little sea salt as well.
