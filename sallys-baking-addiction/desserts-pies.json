    "description": "This is my favorite homemade chocolate cake recipe. With a super moist crumb and fudgy, yet light texture, this chocolate cake recipe will be your favorite too. Top with chocolate buttercream and chocolate chips for 3x the chocolate flavor. You can also prepare this chocolate layer cake as a sheet cake. See recipe Note.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 and 3/4 cups (219g) all-purpose flour\u00a0(spooned & leveled)",
      "3/4 cup (62g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder",
      "1 and 3/4 cups (350g) granulated sugar",
      "2 teaspoons baking soda",
      "1 teaspoon baking powder",
      "1 teaspoon salt",
      "2 teaspoons espresso powder (optional)",
      "1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable oil (or canola oil or melted coconut oil)",
      "2 large eggs, at room temperature",
      "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
      "1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, at room temperature",
      "1 cup (240ml) freshly brewed strong hot coffee (regular or decaf)",
      "1 and 1/4 cups (2.5 sticks or 290g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
      "3 and 1/2 cups (420g) confectioners\u2019\u00a0sugar",
      "3/4 cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or dutch process)",
      "3\u20135 Tablespoons (45-75ml) heavy cream (or half-and-half or milk), at room temperature",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt",
      "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "optional for decoration: semi-sweet chocolate chips"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)",
      "Make the cake:\u00a0Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is completely combined. Batter is thin.",
      "Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (Note: Even if they\u2019re completely done, the cooled cakes may *slightly* sink in the center. Cocoa powder is simply not as structurally strong as all-purpose flour and can\u2019t hold up to all the moisture necessary to make a moist tasting chocolate cake. It\u2019s normal!)",
      "Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack.\u00a0Allow to cool completely in the pan.",
      "Make the buttercream: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy \u2013 about 2 minutes. Add confectioners\u2019 sugar, cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners\u2019 sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is too thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is too thick. (I usually add 1 more.) Taste. Add another pinch of salt if desired.",
      "Assemble and frost: If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called \u201cleveling\u201d the cakes. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula\u00a0and\u00a0bench scraper for the frosting. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired.",
      "Refrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing to help set the shape. After that, you can serve the cake or continue refrigerating for up to 4\u20136 hours before serving. Cake can be served at room temperature or chilled.",
      "Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days. I like using a cake carrier for storing and transporting."
    ],
    "notes": [
      "Make Ahead & Freezing Instructions: Prepare cake through step 4. Wrap the individual baked and cooled cake layers tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze up to 3 months. Bring to room temperature then continue with step 5. You can prepare the chocolate buttercream 2-3 days in advance. Cover and refrigerate, then bring to room temperature before spreading onto/assembling the cake. Frosted cake freezes well, up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then bring to room temperature or serve cold.",

      "3 Layer Cake: You can also prepare this cake as a 3 layer cake. Divide batter between three 8-inch or 9-inch cake pans in step 1 and bake for 22-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. This frosting will be enough for 3 layers. If desired, use the frosting recipe from my Pi\u00f1ata Cake if you want extra frosting.",
      "Cocoa Powder: Use natural cocoa powder in the cake, not dutch-process. (See dutch-process vs natural cocoa powder for more information.) Since there is no leavening occurring in frosting, you can use either natural or dutch-process in the chocolate buttercream.",
      "Buttermilk: Buttermilk is required for this recipe. You can make your own DIY version of buttermilk if needed. Add 2 teaspoons of white vinegar or lemon juice to a liquid measuring cup. Then add enough room temperature whole milk to the same measuring cup until it reaches 1 cup. (In a pinch, lower fat or nondairy milks work for this soured milk, but the cake won\u2019t taste as moist or rich.) Stir it around and let sit for 5 minutes. The homemade \u201cbuttermilk\u201d will be somewhat curdled and ready to use in the recipe.",
      "Sour Cream Version: Lately I\u2019ve been using a mix of sour cream and buttermilk, as well as reducing the hot coffee. Reduce the buttermilk and hot coffee to 1/2 cup (120ml) each. Add 3/4 cup (180g) of room temperature full-fat sour cream with the wet ingredients. You can see this described above, in the video tutorial, and in my dark chocolate mousse cake. That cake and this cake are both fantastically moist, but the sour cream version has a slightly sturdier crumb.",
      "FAQ: The sour cream version (note above) makes a sturdy enough cake that will hold under fondant.",
      "Amount of Cake Batter: This recipe (and the sour cream version) yields about 6 cups of batter, which is helpful if you need it for different Cake Pan Sizes & Conversions.",
      "Room Temperature Ingredients: All refrigerated items should be at room temperature so the batter mixes together easily and evenly. Read more about why room temperature ingredients are important.",
      "Espresso Powder/Coffee: Espresso powder and coffee will not make the cake taste like coffee. Instead, they deepen the chocolate flavor. I highly recommend them both. You can use the same amount of instant coffee (the powder) instead of espresso powder if desired. If coffee isn\u2019t your thing, you can leave out the espresso powder and use extra hot water or hot chai tea.",
      "Bundt Pan: I recommend my chocolate cream cheese bundt cake but without the cream cheese filling. Reduce buttermilk in that recipe to 1/4 cup and increase sour cream to 1 cup.",
      "9\u00d713 Inch Pan: You can bake this cake in a 9\u00d713-inch baking pan. Same oven temperature, about 35-40 minutes bake time.",
      "Chocolate Cupcakes: Here is my favorite chocolate cupcakes recipe. Same unbelievable texture as this cake! (You\u2019ll notice I don\u2019t use hot liquid in that recipe. That\u2019s because there isn\u2019t the same volume of dry ingredients to break up. If you need more than 1 dozen chocolate cupcakes, use this chocolate cake recipe for 2-3 dozen. Same baking instructions as my chocolate cupcakes."

      "Make the reduced strawberry puree first, and let cool: Puree 1 pound of rinsed and hulled strawberries. You should have a little over 1 cup. Stirring occasionally, simmer the puree over medium-low heat until you\u2019re left with 1/2 cup or slightly more (you need 1/2 cup for the cake). This takes at least 25\u201335 minutes, but could take longer depending on your pan or how juicy your strawberries were. Allow to cool completely before using in cake batter. I always make the reduced puree the day before so it has plenty of time to cool down. I cover and place in the refrigerator overnight. Allow it to come back to room temperature before adding to the cake batter. (See Notes for further make-ahead instructions.)",
      "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it\u2019s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)",
      "Make the cake: Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Beat in the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk *just* until combined. Do not overmix. Whisk in 1/2 cup of room-temperature reduced strawberry puree, making sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick. Stir in food coloring, if desired. (I use 1 small drop of pink gel food coloring.)",
      "Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 24\u201325 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.",
      "Make the frosting:\u00a0Using a blender or food processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a powdery crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup crumbs. Set aside. In a large bowl using a hand-held or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese for 1 minute on high speed until completely smooth and creamy. Beat in the butter until combined. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar, strawberry powder, 1 Tablespoon milk, and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy. Add 1 more Tablespoon of milk to slightly thin out, if desired. Taste, then add a pinch of salt if needed. Yields about 3 cups of frosting.",
      "Assemble and frost:\u00a0First, using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides. Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake keep its shape when cutting\u2014it could slightly fall apart without time in the fridge.",

Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers can be frozen for up to 2\u20133 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving.

I\u2019m unsure about sugar substitutes, but let me know if you try any.",

    "description": "With its super-moist and buttery texture, banana and brown sugar flavors, soft crumb, and 1,000+ reviews, this is a delicious AND undeniably popular banana bread recipe. You need 4 large ripe bananas.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour\u00a0(spooned & leveled)",
      "1 teaspoon baking soda",
      "1/4 teaspoon salt",
      "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
      "1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
      "3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar",
      "2 large eggs, at room temperature",
      "1/3 cup (80g) plain yogurt or sour cream, at room temperature",
      "2 cups (460g) mashed bananas (about 4 large ripe bananas)",
      "1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract",
      "optional: 3/4 cup (100g) chopped pecans or walnuts"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Lowering the oven rack prevents the top of your bread from browning too much, too soon. Grease a metal 9\u00d75-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray. Set aside.",
      "Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
      "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. With the mixer running on medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract until combined.",
      "With the mixer running on low speed, slowly beat the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no flour pockets remain. Do not over-mix. Fold in the nuts, if using.",
      "Pour and spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 60\u201365 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from getting too brown. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs. This may be after 60\u201365 minutes depending on your oven, so begin checking every 5 minutes around the 60-minute mark.",
      "Remove bread from the oven and allow the bread to cool in the pan set on a wire rack for 1 hour. Remove bread from the pan and cool bread directly on the wire rack until ready to slice and serve.",
      "Cover and store banana bread at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Banana bread tastes best on day 2 after the flavors have settled together. See post above for freezing instructions."

      "Butter: If needed, you can use salted butter in this recipe with no other changes needed. I\u2019ve also successfully reduced the butter down to 6 Tablespoons (85g) with no issue (just as tasty).",
      "Brown Sugar: This is not an overly sweet quick bread. If you want a sweeter banana bread, increase to 1 cup (200g) brown sugar. Feel free to replace some or all of the brown sugar with regular white granulated sugar.",
      "Cream Cheese Frosting: This banana bread also tastes fantastic with cream cheese frosting on top! To make it, beat 4 ounces (112g) of softened cream cheese and 1/4 cup (60g) of softened unsalted butter together on medium speed until smooth. Beat in 1 cup (120g) of confectioners sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt until combined. Spread on cooled loaf.",
      "Banana Bread Muffins:\u00a0Use this banana bread recipe to make 15 banana bread muffins. Spoon the batter into a lined or greased muffin pan (fill each to the top with batter) and bake for 5 minutes at 425\u00b0F (218\u00b0C); then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Bake for an additional 16\u201317 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total bake time for the banana bread muffins is about 21\u201323 minutes. The initial burst of hot air helps those muffins rise nice and tall! Or try my quick & easy banana muffins.",
      "Brown Sugar: Feel free to substitute the same amount of regular white granulated sugar or coconut sugar. I do not recommend any liquid sweeteners.",
      "No Sour Cream or Yogurt? Feel free to use 1/3 cup mashed banana (in addition to the 2 cups), unsweetened applesauce, or even canned pumpkin puree.",
      "Frozen Bananas: You can use frozen bananas here. Thaw the frozen bananas. Drain off any excess liquid, mash, then use as instructed in the recipe. See How to Freeze & Thaw Bananas for Baking. Try not to mash too much or else you\u2019ll be left with 2 cups of banana-y liquid; some chunks are great.",
      "Chocolate Chips: I love this bread with chocolate chips, too. Feel free to add 1 cup of your favorite chocolate chips. No need to leave out the nuts if you add the chocolate chips. Chocolate chips and nuts are both optional.",
      "Can I Turn This Into Banana Bundt Cake? There isn\u2019t enough batter. I recommend using my extremely similar, scaled-up recipe for chocolate marble banana Bundt cake instead. You can leave out the chocolate swirl in that recipe."

Always bake lemon bars at a lower temperature to avoid over-baking. See recipe notes for important tips. They\u2019re simply the best lemon bars and are perfect for picnics, bake sales, spring brunches, baby showers, and bridal showers.",
    "ingredients": [
      "1 cup (230g; 2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted",
      "1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar",
      "2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract",
      "1/2 teaspoon salt",

      "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C).\u00a0Line the bottom and sides of a 9\u00d713 glass baking pan (do not use metal) with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished bars out (makes cutting easier!). Set aside.",
      "Make the crust: Mix the melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the flour and stir to completely combine. The dough will be thick. Press firmly into prepared pan, making sure the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the warm crust (not all the way through the crust). A new step I swear by, this helps the filling stick and holds the crust in place. Set aside until step 4.",
      "Make the filling: Sift the sugar and flour together in a large bowl. Whisk in the eggs, then the lemon juice until completely combined.",
      "Pour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and no longer jiggles. (Give the pan a light tap with an oven mitt to test.) Remove bars from the oven and cool completely at room temperature. I usually cool them for about 2 hours at room temperature, then stick in the refrigerator for 1-2 more hours until pretty chilled. I recommend serving chilled.",
      "Once cool,\u00a0lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides. Dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar and cut into squares before serving. For neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut. Cover and store leftover lemon bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.",
      "Freezing Instructions: Lemon bars can be frozen for up to 3-4 months. Cut the cooled bars (without confectioners\u2019 sugar topping) into squares, then place onto a baking sheet. Freeze for 1 hour. Individually wrap each bar in aluminum foil or plastic wrap and place into a large bag or freezer container to freeze. Thaw in the refrigerator, then dust with confectioners\u2019 sugar before serving."

      "Special Tools (affiliate links): 9\u00d713-Inch Glass Pan | Glass Mixing Bowls | Spatula | Silicone Whisk | Juicer | Fine Mesh Sieve",

      "Sifting: More often than not, the flour doesn\u2019t fully incorporate into the lemon filling unless it\u2019s sifted with the sugar. As directed in the recipe, sift the two together before adding the eggs and lemon juice. I don\u2019t always do this (and didn\u2019t even do it in the video above!) but it\u2019s preferred to avoid any flour lumps. If you have a sifter, it\u2019s worth using. If you forget, it\u2019s not a huge deal. Here is my favorite sifter. You use it again to dust the lemon bars with confectioners\u2019 sugar.",
      "Lemon Juice: For exceptional taste, I highly recommend fresh lemon juice. Here is a wonderful inexpensive juicer if you don\u2019t have one. Or use another fresh-squeezed citrus like grapefruit, blood orange, lime, or regular orange. You can slightly reduce the sugar if using a sweeter citrus. I recommend no less than 1 and 2/3 cup granulated sugar in the filling as it\u2019s needed for structure.",
      "Room Temperature: Bringing the eggs and lemon juice to room temperature helps them mix easier into the flour and sugar. However, I never notice a taste or texture difference when using cold. Room temperature or cold, use whichever!"

      "Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes.\u00a0*If you don\u2019t have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula in the next step.",
      "Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for 5 minutes (for a visual, watch me do it in the video above). The dough can be a little too heavy for a mixer to knead it, but you can certainly use the mixer on low speed instead. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger \u2013 if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading.",
      "Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray\u2013 just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature\u00a0for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150\u00b0F (66\u00b0C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When it\u2019s doubled in size, remove from the oven.)",
      "Preheat oven to 475\u00b0F (246\u00b0C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza. (If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.) Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor.",
      "Shape the dough: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. (If not making 2 pizzas, freeze half of the dough for another time. See freezing instructions below.) On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle, about 1/2-inch thick. If the dough keeps shrinking back as you try to stretch it, stop what you\u2019re doing, cover it lightly for 5-10 minutes, then try again. Once shaped into a 12-inch circle, lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. I simply pinch the edges up to create the rim. If using a pizza stone, place the dough directly on baker\u2019s peels dusted with cornmeal.",
      "Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you prepare your pizza toppings. I suggest pepperoni & green peppers or jalape\u00f1o slices, extra cheese pizza,\u00a0Hawaiian pizza,\u00a0pesto pizza, spinach artichoke white pizza, or\u00a0homemade BBQ chicken pizza.",
      "Top & bake the pizza: Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. To prevent the filling from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the top lightly with olive oil. Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 13-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.",

      "Freezing Instructions: This recipe yields enough dough for two 12-inch pizzas, a little less than 2 pounds total. After the pizza dough rises and you divide the dough in half (step 5), you can freeze one of the balls of dough to make pizza at a later time. Or you can simply freeze both balls of dough separately. Lightly coat all sides of the dough ball(s) with nonstick spray or olive oil. Place the dough ball(s) into individual zipped-top bag(s) and seal tightly, squeezing out all the air. Freeze for up to 3 months. To thaw, place the frozen pizza dough in the refrigerator for about 8 hours or overnight. When ready to make pizza, remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow to rest for 1 hour on the counter. Preheat the oven and continue with step 5, punching down the dough to release air if needed.",
      "Overnight/All Day Instructions:\u00a0Prepare the dough through step 3, but allow the dough to rise for 8-12 hours in the refrigerator. (If it needs to be in the refrigerator for longer, use cooler water in the dough which will slow the dough\u2019s rise and allow for more time.) The slow rise gives the pizza dough wonderful flavor! When ready, continue with step 4. If the dough didn\u2019t quite double in size overnight, let it sit at room temperature for 30-45 minutes before punching down (step 5).",
